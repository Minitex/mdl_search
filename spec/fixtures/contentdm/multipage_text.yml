    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    Improve Your Dairy Cows
    The only successful method of improving your dairy herd is through the
    selection of a good dairy sire. No matter what kind of herd of cows you
    may have, a good dairy sire of the oldest known breed in the world will help
    you get better milkers. The high price of all the products of the dairy cow
    makes it necessary to use better cows to get the best of your feed values and
    when thinking over this proposition why not get the best? Get a cow that will
    stand the weather and one that will eat all the rough feed on the farm and turn
    it into a good profit. This means that you will strongly consider the merits of
    the
    Holstein-Friesian
    before you purchase a sire. And why a Holstein ? Because they hold, unchallenged the world's official butter records for any age core for seven, fourteen,
    thirty, sixty day or six months test and also hold all the official milk records of
    the world. Then why are they not the best for the average farmer to raise?
    They are large in size and are easy milkers.
    Before You Purchase a Sire
    do not fail to xorite to Spring Brook Farm, Northfield, Minn., to get prices,
    breeding, etc. Here you will find ninety head of the very choicest animals in
    the west and we now have on hand a dozen head of fine young sires.
    One nearly white, 18 months old from a cow that has made an official
    butter record of over twenty pounds of butter in seven days.
    Another from Creamelle 2nd's Topsy Ann, whose daughter holds the
    world's milk record of 26,280 pounds. This sire is just two years old and is a
    very fine individual.   We have many others that are ready for service.
    Write at once or call at any time
    SPRING BROOK FARM
    Only one mile from Northfield, Minn.

    Heatwole's Dairy Paper.
    Vol. II, No. 10
    Northfield, Minn., December, 1907.
    50 Cents 3 Years
    A GREAT DAIRY STATE
    FOUR    HUNDRED     MILLION    DOLLARS SPENT ANNUALLY FOR
    NATION'S BUTTER.
    HOW MINNESOTA STANDS
    Requires a Train  of Cars Two  Hundreds Miles Long to Carry
    Country's Butter.
    eries in 1907 will produce one hundred
    million pounds of the best butter in
    the world and it would require a train
    of cars, each car containing 40,000
    pounds, two hundred miles in length
    to convey it to market. Don't these
    figures impress you with the magnitude of the output and it must clearly
    convince you of the great importance
    of the industry and the responsibility
    of the work of our department. Ten
    per cent of the population of the United States is engaged in dairying, but
    statistics show that fourteen of our
    forty-five States produce the butter
    which enters the great commercial centers.    Nearly two billion pounds are
    The wonderful development of our
    dairy resources in the past eighteen
    years, and especially along co-operative lines, is the model and marvel of
    other States; but in truth we must
    say the Lord made our great commonwealth a dairy State and the wise and
    helpful guidance of the State Dairy
    & Food department and other splendid
    educational forces have been a finger
    board to the intelligent husbandman
    to take the land and join the march
    of progress. We say the Lord made
    Minnesota a dairy State because He
    adorned the 79,000 square miles of
    our territory with ten thousand lakes
    and spread upon the prairies the finest
    grasses that grow in the world and
    every lake, stream and blade of grass
    has been an invitation to man to join
    in the great work of making Minnesota the richest and most progressive
    dairy region of the world. Already
    about seventy-five thousand of our farmers have accepted the invitation and
    are not only enriching the earth, but
    are surely blessed from the storehouse of nature which sets the table
    of the nation. We now have over nine
    hundred and twenty-six creameries
    and seventy-seven per cent of them
    are owned and operated by the farmers. Their wonderful success proves
    that the principle is fundamentally
    right and that greater good will follow in the evolution of the business.
    No industry is doing more for the material well being of our people than
    that of tbe dairy, and no department
    of the State government comes in
    closer touch with the producer of our
    vast dairy wealth than does the Dairy
    & Food department   Minnesota cream-
    WILLIAM W. WALL,
    Secretary State Dairy and Food Commission, Minnesota.
    The man who has done much to advance the dairy interests of Minnesota to the front rank.
    made and sold annually in the United
    States. This would give a return of
    nearly four hundred million dollars
    for butter alone. This may seem incredible to the average mind, but statistics tell us that butter furnishes
    19.7 per cent of the total fat in the
    average American diet. The average
    consumption in this country is about
    twenty pounds per capita and the best
    product finds a ready sale. The valua
    of dairy products of the United States
    is almost five per cent of all our agricultural products. It is also shown by
    statistics that 94 per cent of the butter made in this country is consumed
    by our own citizens.
    But let me return to the facts showing the growth of the co-operative idea
    in the ownership and management of
    Minnesota creameries.   On June 16th,
    1890  the  first  co-operative   creamery
    in    Minnesota    was    established    at
    Clark's Grove, Freeborn county.    On
    July 31st, 1892 there were 266 creameries in our State and only thirteen
    of these were co-operative.   On March
    1st, 1894 our records show that there
    were  253  creameries  doing  business
    within our boundaries, being 12 less
    than there were in 1892; but the num
    ber of co-operative creameries had increased from 13 to 164, plainly show
    ing the evolution of the great industry.
    In 1896 there were 445 creameries of
    which 302 were co-operative.    This is
    a good showing as there were 148 more
    co-operative creameries in 1896 than
    there were in 1894.    Taking the r«c
    ords of 1898 we find that there were
    551 creameries in Minnesota of which
    number 419   were   conducted on   the
    co-operative   basis.     This   is   a  gain
    of 117 in two years showing the steady
    growth of the co-operative idea among
    our farmers. The biennial period from
    1898 to 1900 was not productive of so
    large an increase in the  total number of creameries,  there being only
    582—but thirty-one   more than    were
    operated in 1898.   The number operated on a co-operative basis increased
    from 419 to 438. During the two years
    from 1900 to 1902 our creameries increased  from  582  to  690—a gain oi
    108 and there was a gain of 89 in the
    co-operative  class.    The   biennial  report of 1904 gives the total number
    of creameries at 770 of which 572 were
    co-operative.    In 1906 the number of
    creameries, reporting   to this department was 926 of which 719 were cooperative.    The increase  in the production of creamery butter has been
    quite phenomenal   as   the   following

    In no other State in the union has
    the co-operative idea been so generally adopted in the operation of creameries as in Minnesota, and in some
    States the central plants have almost
    crushed out the smaller plants. Time
    will further demonstrate that the co
    operative scheme is the proper one,
    and here permit me to say that there
    is no more promising field open to the
    industrious home builder than Is offered in the North Star State.
    —W. W. WALL.
    SPARE THE BIRDS.
    Think of a Few Things Next Time
    You   Shoot  Birds.
    "Our hours," said a nature student,
    "are nothing to the birds. Why, some
    birds work in summer nineteen hours
    a day. Indefatigably they clear the
    crops of insects.
    "The thrush gets up at 2:30 every
    summer morning. He rolls up his
    sleeves and falls to work at once, and
    he never stops till 9:30 at night. A
    clean 19 hours. During that time he
    feeds his voracious young 206 times.
    "The blackbird starts work at the
    same time as the thrush, but he lays
    off earlier. His whistle blows at 7:30,
    and during his seventeen-hour day he
    sets about 100 meals for his kiddies.
    "The titmouse is up and about by

    TRUE TYPE HOLSTEIN
    THE RESULT OF CENTURIES OF
    SHREWD SELECTION AND
    PROPER CARE.
    AMERICAN ANIMALS FINER
    Some   Expert   Opinions   of   the   True
    Type  of the   Breed—Results  of
    Scientific  Study.
    We are indebted to Mr. F. L. Houghton of Brattleboro, Vermont, secretary of the National Holstein-Freisian
    Association, for the following interesting article:
    Considerable public comment on the
    type of Holstein-Friesian cattle is appearing in the agricultural papers is
    very properly directing attention to
    the subject of the true type of the
    breed.
    The breeder, who, for one moment
    is his pursuit of higher fat percentage in the milk, forgets type, is doing incalculable damage to the future
    of  the  breed.
    The true type of the breed is very
    accurately delineated in the scale of
    points. It is to be regretted that illustrations of typical specimens are
    not used to illustrate and emphasize
    this   description.
    Change of environment of this
    breed from the low lands of Holland
    is doubtless effecting a very slight
    change in the bony structure of the
    Holstein, tending toward a greater
    finish or refinement. Aside from this
    natural process, it is very doubtful
    whether any improvement can be
    made or should be attempted. The
    Holland type is the result of centuries of selection and environment,
    and it has distinguished these cattle
    in all parts of the world. With it has
    come the marvelous and profitable
    production or yield, the characteristic
    tendencies of powerful digestion and
    perfect assimilation of food. These
    characteristics, derived from the Holstein, have been important factors in
    the foundation stock of the Shorthorn and Ayshire breeds and of many
    Continental off-shoots.
    In America it was the Holland type
    that by its productice power directed
    the attention of agriculturists towards
    this breed, and it is safe to assert
    that an examination of the great majority of remarkable yields will show,
    to those having means of access to
    photographs or descriptions, the close
    adherence to the Holland type in all
    these wonderful animals. Large size
    in the Holstein is the first thing to
    impress the casual observer, and its
    importance should never be disregarded. In defining pure bred Holstein
    cattle, this fact was duly set forth by
    the founders of the herd-book association, in these words, which should never be forgotten, no matter what may
    be the yield in milk or its fat percentage, viz: "Pure bred Holstein-
    Friesian shall be held to mean and
    refer to only those large, improved
    black and white cattle, etc." (Art. 4,
    Section 5, By-Laws of H. F. A. of A.)
    Scientific investigation in this country, particularly in Wisconsin, has
    confirmed the wisdom of the early
    breeders in thus defining the type
    of the breed as "large," for the large
    cow of any bred is uniformly the
    more profitable. An idea of the size
    of animals of this breed, at the time
    of Mr. Chenery's first importations,
    may be gained from the following
    quotation. (Vol. 2 Holstein H. B. folio
    19). "The bill, Van Tromp (see portrait) imported in the womb of Texe-
    laar, is now six years old, and his
    girth is 8 feet 5 inches; length, 9 feet
    2 inches; height, 5 feet 2 inches;
    weight, 2,700 pounds; and the weignc
    of the two-years-old bull, Opperdoes
    7th, is 1,597 pounds. The weight of
    the imported cow, Texelaar (see portrait), is 1,560 pounds; Lady Mid-
    would (see portait), 1,620 pounds; the
    four-year-old heifer, Opperdoes 3d
    (see portait), 1,495 pounds; the three-
    years-old heifer, Texelaar 6th, 1,500
    pounds; the two-years-old heifer, Texelaar 8th, 1,290 pounds; the yearling
    heifer, Zuider Zee 5th, 900 pounds;
    the bull-calf, Duke of Belmont, nine
    months old, 710 pounds, and the heifer
    calf, Midwould 8th, nine months old,
    G35 pounds; all raised in the ordinary way, without forcing, the young
    animals running in pasture from May
    until November."
    Burton W. Potter, in 1906, published the results of his investigations as
    to the weight of sixty large record
    cows, tested under the present Advanced Registry system, 1894 to 1906.
    Mr. Potter summarizes thus: "Of
    the sixty cows, only thirteen weigh
    more than 1,500 pounds each and
    only twenty-seven surpass the 1,400
    pound mark. Only nine weigh less
    than 1,200 pounds, and the average
    weight of the whole number is 1,383
    pounds, etc. "Of the twenty-five
    bulls, not one weighs less than 1,800
    pounds and only five less than 2,000
    pounds. Only three weigh more than
    2,400 pounds, and the average weight
    of the whole number is 2,164 pounds.
    Mr. S. Hoxie, in the pamphlet, "Holstein-Friesian cattle" (1905) writing
    upon the size of cows, states, "In ordinary milking condition at full age,
    they range in weight from 1000 to
    1500 pounds."

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    predominent characteristic of the
    breed, aside from their beautiful black
    and white color markings in perfectly defined patches or spots, the next
    general definition relates to the general conformation of the animal. There
    are three definite types, described as
    the milk and beef form, the milk
    lorm, and beef and milk form.
    The average form of this breed
    and that toward which conscientious
    breeders are directing their efforts to
    maintain and improve, is the milk and
    beef form.
    Mr. S. Hoxie thus admirably refers
    to the milk and beef type of the
    breed: "It is especially strong in all
    vital particulars. The bones are fine
    compared with size, and the chine
    broad, and strong compared with the
    high and sharp chine of the extreme
    milk form. The loin and hips are
    broad and smooth, and the rump high
    and level, compared with the angularity usually shown in the milk form.
    The twist is roomy and the thighs
    and hocks well apart. Passing forward the shoulders are smoother and
    more compact than in the milk form,
    but of lighter weight than in the beef
    form. The brisket is not so wide and
    low as in the beef form, and the chest
    is not so deep, but the width of the
    beef form through at the heart is closely retained. In the milk form the abdomen is usually swung low, and the
    ribs are steep, but in the milk and
    beef form the ribs are wider sprung
    and the abdomen more trimly held
    up though no less capacious. The
    general appearance of the bull is
    strongly masculine, but that of the
    cow is no less femine than in the milk
    form."
    It may be further emphasized, that
    the milk and beef form, describes a
    cow of the wedge form, with shoulders moderately thick, deep and broad
    crops well filled, barrel well rounded,
    loin and hips broad and full, and
    quarters straight, wide and full.
    To this form of these cattle is due
    their extraordinary constitutional vigor or vital force, and it affects all
    their relations to their good, care and
    productions.
    The milk and beef form is not accompanied with the angularity of appearance, the light shoulders and
    chest, and the comparatively light
    quarters of cattle of the milk form.
    The future of the breed will be
    greatly endangered by those, who,
    from one consideration or another,
    the combination of pedigrees to attain large average records or fat percentages, or by neglect of proper feed
    and care in the early life of the animal, are led to the mating of animals
    of other than those of large size, and
    possessing the milk and beef form.
    Neither the breeds of the Channel
    Islands nor the Ayshire breed possesses this form, even ranio1;ly.

    BUTTER A  FINISHED  PRODUCT.
    Farmers Should Join Hands and Own
    The Creameries.
    J. R. Morley, of Owatonna, the gentleman who spoke on the subject of
    co-operative creameries here last Saturday, made a strong plea for loyal
    support of home creameries. He believes that every creamery should be
    owned by the farmers. In this way
    only can they get for their cairy
    products the best the market aifords.
    Farmers who ship their cream and
    do not patronize the home creamery,
    if there is one to patronize, make a
    mistake. But the greatest mistake
    Mr. Morley thinks is for the farmers
    not to own their own creameries This
    line of business belongs to them and
    no one else and they should take advantage of that fact and go in to niako
    the most of it. There is no good reason why the farmer should not himself market the finished product of the
    dairy. No good reason why the farmer should not sell butter instead of
    cream. It is not convenient for a
    farmer with a large dairy herd to convert all his cream into butter. But it
    is convenient for that same farmer
    to join hands with other farmers similarly situated and for all of them to
    make their butter in common. This
    is what the local creamery does. It
    makes butter for the community. It
    is the common churn to which all the
    farmers of a given locality bring their
    cream and have it turned into butter. Is it not plain that such an institution should be owned, controlled and operated by the farmers themselves? Every industry should endeav
    or as far as practicable to dispose of
    a finished product. Cream is not a
    finished product of the dairy. Butter
    is. The finished product commands
    so much higher price than the raw
    material that in the conversion of one
    into the other lies the largest share
    of net profit. Why should not the farmer have this profit rather than someone else? Some say that local creameries are as a rule a failure. Where
    this has been the case one can in nearly every instance find the cause in
    some local condition, Poor management, the wrangling of local promot
    ers and lack of support are as a rule
    the principal sources of trouble. Farmers must learn to overcome these
    things and having done so they will
    find that no field of co-operation is
    more profitable than that connected
    with ' the dairy business.—Minneota
    Mascot.
    STICK   TO   THE   FARM.
    The Urban Life is the Most Dignified and Pleasant.
    A good living is what comparatively
    few man succeed in making in village
    or city life, and yet nothing is more
    easy of accomplishment on the farm.
    Besides, there is a pleasure in cultivating and embellishing the earth,
    improving and increasing its products, and thus adding to the aggregate of human happiness, why, then,
    should you men hesitate to be farmers' It is both profitable and honorable. It is the nearest approximation to independence that a man, or
    a member of society, can make. A
    gentleman farmer—and all farmers
    are or should be, gentlemen—belongs
    to an order of nobility that is not indebted to placeholders for installation, and may, if he chooses, be ranked among the greatest benefactors of
    the human race.
    KEEP   GOOD   NATURED.
    Cultivate a Sunny Disposition and
    Follow Golden Rule.
    No matter how disagreeable your
    work, or how much trouble you may
    have, resolve that, whatever comes to
    you, you will not allow your disposition to sour, that you will face the
    sunlight, no matter how deep the shadows. You can make poetry out of the
    prosiest life, and bring sunshine into
    the darkest home; you can develop
    beauty and grace amid the ugliest
    surroundings. It is not circumstances,
    so much as attitude of mind, that gives
    happiness. Who can estimate the value
    of a nature so sunny that it attracts
    everybody. Everybody wants to get
    near sunny people; everybody likes to
    know them. They open, without effort, doors which morose natures are
    obliged to pry open with great difficulty, or perhaps cannot open at all.

    \   Would    Require    a    Train    Thirty\nMiles   Long   to   Haul   the   Rice\nCounty
    Products to Market.\nRice county though one of the smallest counties of Minnesota,
    containing\nbut 497 square miles, is one of the\nbanner dairy counties of the
    State.\nThe county was organized in 1853 and\nwas named in honor of Hon. Henry\nM.
    Rice, who came to the territory\nin 1839, and who later represented the\nState
    in the United States senate.\nEven your pioneer settlers found the\ncounty eminently
    suitable for dairying and were aided in their efforts\nat home-building by the
    cow with the\n\"crumpled horn.\" In I860 Rice county had a population of 7,543
    and in\n1905 it had reached 26,247. As in other counties, in pioneer days, the
    farmers of Rice county raised and hauled wheat long distances to market;\nbut
    we find by our records that as\nearly as 1886 dairying had become a\nfixed idea,
    and rightfully so, among\nyour husbandman, in fact they were\nthen supplying milk
    to five creameries\nand three cheese factories, and were\nlaying the foundation
    for the future\nsuccess of the great industry which\nhas done so much for the
    name and\nfame of the North Star State.\nIn 1888 Minnesota had 146 creameries,
    all operated under private ownership, and Rice county contained two,\na loss of
    one In two years.\nTaking our records for 1890 we find\nthat your county had three
    creameries,\na gain of one, but In 1892 the number\nhad increased to eleven. Between\n1892
    and 1894 there was a recession\nin the number for in the latter years\nonly five
    creameries were reported in\noperation. In that year there were but\n253 creameries
    in the State, a gain of\n107 in six years. In 1896 the number of creameries in
    the county had\nincreased from five to twelve and in\nthe State the number had
    increased\nfrom 253 to 445, and most of the new\nplants were on a co-operative
    basis.\nOur records show that in 1898 Rice\ncounty had eighteen creameries, the\nlargest
    number in its history, and in\nthat year we notice that Joseph Plon-\nty, of Morristown,
    and W. I. Noyes, of\nMoland, secured scores in the State\ncontests of 97% and
    95%.   This was\nYour Profits Are Cut\nAt FOUR Points by ABORTION\n1. You Lose

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    UNSANITARY COW STABLES.
    What Prof. Pearson of the Pennsylvania Station Has Discovered.
    We have called the attention of our
    readers, and especially those who are
    engaged in dairying, to the necessity
    of having sanitary stables as well as
    sanitary homes. By way of adding
    emphasis to what we have already
    said we call their attention to an address delivered by Prof. R. A. Pearson, giving the result of an experiment lasting seventeen months at the
    Pennsylvania Experiment Station, as
    follows:
    Two herds of six cows each were
    kept in two stables. In each lot were
    two cows known to be tuberculous and
    four that were known to be healthy.
    A tuberculous cow was placed between
    the healthy cows in each stable. The
    tuberculous cows were frequently
    changed from one stable to the other,
    so that the healthy cows in each stable
    should have the same exposure. One
    stable -was light, roomy, clean, and
    well ventilated; the other dark,
    small, unclean, and poorly ventilated.
    At the end of seventeen months all
    the cows were killed. In the unsanitary stable all that were healthy when
    they went In were found to be badly
    diseased. In the sanitary stable two
    of the healthy cows had contracted
    the disease, but were not in nearly
    as b?d a condition as those in the
    unsanitary stable.
    This experiment shows that although
    sanitation will not prevent cattle from
    contracting tuberculosis, if they are
    placed In close proximity to diseased
    animals, the disease makes much less
    rapid progress under sanitary conditions when the animals are so placed.
    If our readers who are keeping
    dairy cows will see that the stables
    in which they are kept are well lighted and well ventilated it will save
    them more money than any other investment of a like sum. This disease
    of tuberculosis is becoming more and
    more dangerous every year, not merely to the cattle hut still more so to
    hogs. When the farmer finds that
    his hogs have been found on inspection to be tuberculous he may know
    to a dead certainty that his cows are.
    The sooner he takes our advice and
    has his cows tested, and then fattens
    and sells subject to inspection those
    that react, the better off he will be
    and the better off his neighbors will
    be. The man who follows this method
    is a public benefactor and also incurs
    the minimum of loss. The man who
    finds out that his cattle are tuberculous and sells them to a neighbor for
    breeding purposes forfeits, and should
    forfeit, the friendship of that neighbor for a long time.
    The religion you can keep to yourself Is not worth giving away.
    USING A CREAM   HARVESTER.
    The Modern Way of Making Profit
    On Cows With Little Labor.
    The arguments in favor of a cream
    harvester or separator when stated
    within reason are perfectly legitimate. They all resolve themselves
    finally into the one great consideration
    of greater profit from the cows. It is
    not disputed that more cream can be
    gathered from the milk with a cream
    separator than by the old way. It
    therefore avoids waste. Less labor
    is required, because you can make
    skimming and milking practically one
    job. Everything is completed morning and evening, and you are off to
    market with the cream and the milk
    is ready for the calves and pigs. This
    skimmed milk is warm, fresh and
    sweet, and is a much better feed than
    when cold and stale, if indeed it is
    not sour if skimmed by hand when
    cold. If you market the cream the
    load is much lighter than if you haul
    whole milk to the creamery or the
    railroad. If you are making butter,
    it is possible to make a finer article
    out of separator cream than from
    hand skimmed cream. You are not
    bothered with an endless array of pans
    and crocks, with the never ending jobs
    of washing, sunning, etc. Finally you
    can run your dairy with less labor, or
    you can keep a greater number of
    cows with the same labor.
    These are the plain arguments In
    favor of using a cream separator. As
    we have said, they all tend directly
    toward the matter of profit. It is
    the modern way. The man who expects to make any real profit out of
    his own light by not falling into line
    and availing himself of the helps
    which his neighbors are using.
    All over the country two excellent
    cream harvesters are being offered
    to dairymen by the well known local
    agents of the International Harvester
    Company of America. They are known
    as the Bluebell, a gear drive machine;
    and the Dairymaid, a chain drive machine. Both machines are simple,
    easji running easy to clean, and are
    close skimmers. They have the same
    high reputation that all other machines
    manufactured by the International
    Harvester Company of AmeriGa have.
    You have the advantages of dealing
    direct with local dealers. You know
    that your machine must prove satisfactory. A cream harvester is a good
    thing to have, and the responsible
    local dealer in your own town with
    whom you are personally acquainted
    is a very good man to deal with when
    you go to buy.
    For caked udder use lard with a lit
    tie turpentine and rub well into the
    hard spots after each milking and
    the cake will soon disappear.

    November Oleo Output.
    There was an apparent decrease in
    the output of oleomargarine in the
    Chicago district for the month of
    November, but if it were possible
    to get at the actual sales it is doubtful that the same situation would be
    shown. The Internal Revenue Department reports only the amount of
    stamps sold for that purpose and it Is
    prohable that the oleo manufacturers
    purchased more stamps during October than were needed for that month's
    use. At any rate the reports just received from Chicago give the output
    for November as 3,910,448 lbs. of uncolored, on which a tax of %c per
    pound was paid, and 373,511 lbs, of colored which carried a tax of 10c. This
    makes the total 4,283.959 lbs.

    Poorly Attended Meeting..
    The meeting of the Minnesota Dairymen's Association, at the opera house,
    in this city Tuesday, of the present
    week, was not as well attended as it
    should have been. The gentlemen who
    promised to be here and make addresses were here and they all gave the audience good plain, practical, common
    sense talks. The one thing which they
    all sought to impress upon tbe minds
    of the audience was the importance
    of the dairy interests of this State,
    what it means not only as a means of
    revenue to the farmers of the State,
    but what it means as one of the great
    industries of the State. From what
    was said and vouched for as facts as
    to the profits there is to the farmers in
    the co-operative creamery it is a matter of profoundest surprise that a
    creamery at Madison or anywhere else
    in this State should stand idle. Show
    a business man where his business
    could be strengthened and the net
    results increased and within twenty-
    four hours he will have the field well
    in hand and be reaping the benefit.
    This creamery business needs the
    same energy, nerve and application
    as any other business, and when they
    are applied, results will follow far in
    excess of what can be attained from
    the same amount of capital the farm
    er can invest in any other branch of
    his business, or those gentlemen who
    have made the matter the study of a
    lifetime did not know what they were
    talking about last Tuesday—and we
    all believe they did know and were
    giving plain statements of facts in everything they said. What the creamery at Madison needs is less talk
    and some good, hard work.— Madison Independent-Press.
    Who Owns the Forests.
    At present only about 22 per cent
    of our total forest area is in State or
    national forests, assuming a forest area
    of 700,000,000 acres, the remainder
    being on unreserved public lands or in
    private hands. This condition is represented graphically in figure 8. The
    forest area of the United States is
    amply sufficient, if rightly managed,
    to produce eventually enough timber
    to supply all our needs. Yet private
    owners as well as the State and National governments, must use their
    forest lands in a right way if we are
    to maintain our timber supply.
    Weeds on the western farms will
    soon demand that more sheep be kept.
    Every dairy farmer should have a
    flock. Start with a few and you will
    soon grow to like them so well that
    you would not be without them.

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    AGRICULTURAL   ANNUAL.
    Secretary Wilson Sends Out the Advance Sheet of His Report.
    The advance sheets of the report of
    Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson, for the year 1907, have been received and that part of it dealing with
    the dairy industry is particularly interesting at this time.
    In speaking of the value of farm
    products it says. "There were farm
    dairy products in 1907 which nearly
    reached $800,000,000. The price of
    butter increased 4%c per pound over
    the year 1906 and milk %c per gallon."
    Continuing the report says: "Dairy
    products are much more valuable than
    any crop except corn and are equal
    to one-third of the value of all cereals."
    It would seem that the secretary,
    having this knowledge of the value of
    the dairy products of the United
    States, would see to it that an industry that means so much to the people
    is enttiled to greater recognition at
    the hands of his department than it
    has yet received.
    While it is true that he has given
    us the best administration of the affairs of his office that the country has
    ever had, and he has done more for
    the dairy interest than all his predecessors put together, yet the magnitude of the industry warrants even
    greater attention than he has seen fit
    to give it. The dairy division of the
    agricultural department is entitled to
    a separate bureau by itself at least;
    and it would seem that if its wealth
    producing possibilities were taken into consideration, another cabinet office created for it would not be asking more than it merits. The report,
    dealing with the work being done by
    the department to advance the cause
    of dairying States: "Investigations
    to determine the cause of fishy flavors
    in butter are being continued and
    progress has been made; but a complete solution has not yet been
    reached.
    "Experiments have also been made
    concerning the amount of acidity in
    cream and its effect upon the keeping
    quality of butter. Several thousand
    pounds of butter were made from
    cream having various degrees of acidity and the butter was stored at different temperatures to test its keeping qualities. It was found that pasteurized cream, churned sweet without starter, produced remarkably fine
    butter that kept without deterioration for weeks after it was taken from
    storage. This was at such marked
    variance with the general views of
    buttermakers that it has been deemed
    best to repeat the experiments during
    the coming year. If the findings of
    the past year are confirmed, almost a
    complete revolution in the methods of
    making    butter    from    sweet    cream
    seems likely to occur.
    "During the year an extremely simple and rapid method of determining
    the amount of moisture in butter and
    other products was worked out by the
    dairy division. Application for patent has been made in such a way that
    the apparatus and method may be
    used by any person in the United
    States without the payment of royalty."
    Speaking of the station that has
    been built at Albert Lea, Minn., during the past year the report says:
    "In the spring of 1907 laboratories for
    butter and cheese investigations were
    established at Albert Lea, Minn., in
    co-operation with the Minnesota experiment station. Bacteriological and
    chemical laboratories have been
    built and equipped and arrangements
    have been made for a large supply ot
    milk to be used for experimental purposes."
    Under the head of "Creamery Investigations" we learn: "The economic features of the creamery business
    have reached special attention during
    the past year. Reports were solicited from creameries with a view to
    giving them assistance in their methods of conducting the business. At
    the close of the year from 500 to 600
    creameries were reporting monthly. A
    careful analysis of these reports shows
    a heavy loss to many creameries and
    to the farmers supplying them, owing
    to lax methods and the absence of
    system in keeping records. These
    losses are computed to be not less
    than $5,000,000 a year for the entire
    country.
    "Whenever reports indicating defective work are received letters are written pointing out the defects and suggesting remedies.
    "The market inspection of butter
    at Chicago and New York has been
    continued with a view to assisting
    creameries to improve the quality of
    their product. Large quantities of butter deficient in quality or found in
    these markets. When requested by
    the shipper the experts of the dairy division examine a shipment on its arrival at market and send to him
    promptly a reliable report as to its
    condition and quality. If the butter
    is not of good quality they state what
    the defects are and make suggestions
    for overcoming them. This work has
    resulted in a general improvement
    in the quality of the butter received
    on the markets and has thus enabled
    the creameries to obtain better
    prices."
    The above is among some of the
    most important things in relation to
    the dairy industry that the report
    deals with; but it is filled full of
    interesting and important matter relating to all phases of agriculture, and
    will well repay anyone who is interested to read it from beginning to end.

    HARD MILKING COWS
    "Hard milking" occurs from varied causes
    Sometimes the trouble is due to an unnatural
    construction of the entire length of the canal
    of the teat, sometimes to new growths along
    its course, not unfrequently to little shot
    like bodies attached'to a pedicle, which drop
    into the canal from above snd form a sort of
    ball valve obstruction, and again from injuries received without and occasionally due
    to warty growths at the opening of the teat.
    The firm of Geo. P. Pilling & Son o., Arch-
    St., Philadelphia, Pa., have again made the
    dairy world their debtor by placing on the
    market a set of instruments designed to remedy such hard milking cows.
    ^-..■■■■-i .--=<£>.-
    ,VOJ*«.W>>RD MILKER 0UTFl^W
    By the use of these simple instruments any
    intelligent dairyman can often make a comparatively worthless cow into a good one
    and they are always at hand when an emer
    gency calls for their use Like all the goods
    of this house they are safe, sure and "easy
    to use"
    The Pilling Hard Milker set consists of,
    Teat bistoury-slitter, teat opener, milk tube:
    teat expander and teat soap, all packed in
    neat case.
    Full directions are furnished with the in
    strumenis, and the purchaser is always fre-
    to consult the staff of Veterinarians employ
    ed'by the Messers Pilling, regarding all his
    stock troubles.
    This house is we believe, the first to go to
    the expense of a veterinary staff for the free
    service of their clients,
    Ask them for circular of the Hard Milker
    Set—Do it now.

    of the Northwest.

    of Congress of March 3  1879.
    BREAD AND BUTTER STATE.
    Twenty years ago comparatively few
    people thought of Minnesota, as a
    dairy State. They had only begun
    then, and that In the older settlements,
    to practice diversified farming, and
    the causes which led to that were regarded as calamitous. Disheartening
    crop failures and swarms of insect
    fests were accompanied by a deterioration in the quality of the grain, the
    result of continuous cropping.   But
    'Ills of every shape and every name.
    Transformed to blessings, miss their
    cruel aim"
    under the direction of an overruling
    Providence. The failure of wheat cultivation proved ultimately the best
    thing that could have happened. The
    farmers forced to give us their dependence on a single crop began to
    experiment and the experiment which
    on the whole was proved the most
    satisfactory and the most profitable
    has been that of raising cattle and
    dairying. It is not only because it
    is in itself profitable. It makes other
    branches of farming industry more
    profitable. The maintenance of a dairy
    herd enables the farmer to return to
    the soil much that is taken from it
    in the form of crops. Because a man
    has a good herd of cattle he can raise
    hogs and poultry more profitably. The
    necessity of providing fodder at all
    times for the cattle compelled farmers to give greater attention to the
    cultivation of corn which has taken
    the place of wheat as the .surest and
    most profitable of crops. It encouraged the seeding of lands to clover
    and other forage crops as a means of
    giving new life to worn out soils. It
    was followed by the establishment of
    creameries in due time. The bringing of the butter made at these creameries into competition with that made
    in other States has demonstrated that
    whether through accident or design
    the farmers of Minnesota had engaged
    in that industry to which the soil is
    best adopted. Much as the State owes
    to the capacity, the industry and the
    intelligence of its buttermakers, that
    does not altogether account for the
    superiority of Minnesota butter as
    demonstrated again and again in national contests. There must be many
    men as competent as they are in Iowa,
    in Michigan, in Indiana, in New York
    in Ohio and elsewhere. But nowhere
    else than in the great State of
    in Minnesota can be found exactly
    that combination of succulent grasses and other natural food products
    best adopted to the feeding of dairy
    cattle. Minnesota is par excellence
    the dairy State not because of acquired knowledge but because of natural
    gifts.
    At first it was thought that the dairy
    industry would be confined to Southern Minnesota. We are learning better. At the last annual meeting of the
    Dairymen's association, in one of the
    most interesting papers read, a young
    dairyman told how, in the home of
    No. 1 hard wheat he had been able to
    lift a mortgage of $4,000 incurred in
    attempting to make money from the
    favorite crop of that section, by forsaking the old methods and taking up
    dairying. All over that fertile valley
    men are today looking to dairying as
    the industry of the future. It wasn't
    so long ago that people though they
    saw hope for the cut-over pine district
    between St. Paul and Duluth as a
    region specially adopted to the raising of potatoes. They too have learned better. It has been found that in
    those sandy soils not only do taters
    yield abundantly, but that nowhere
    else in the State can such crops of
    timothy and clover be grown and
    wherever there is clover and timothy
    there are other grasses to combine
    with them to make good grazing.
    Those familiar with the country are
    strong in the conviction that here is
    a great future for cut over pine lands
    as the seat of a dairy industry. So
    that dairying can no longer be regarded as confined to the southern
    counties. It is making way everywhere. In every section, except perhaps in the extreme north, it is certain in a future which is not very far
    distant to add materially to the wealth
    and the resources of the agricultural
    population.
    Not the least of the advantages of
    the growth of the dairy industry has
    been the encouragement of co-operation among the farmers. To produce
    the best results they have found it
    necessary to work together. Thus
    they have built their own creameries
    and secured for themselves, in some
    counties almost exclusively, the profits which would otherwise have gone
    to middlemen. The dairymen have
    transacted their own business. The
    co-operative creamery has had an educational value it Is hard to overestimate. It has a social value too,
    and   through   it  men   have   come   to
    know each other better and to be better qualified to take an intelligent part
    in business and in public affairs.
    The advantage of all this is being
    felt more and more in every part of
    the State. The dairy industry has
    come to be regarded as one of 'he
    most important of the resources of
    the State. Creamery products are not
    only more a dependence as a source
    of income than the crops, the price not
    generally being subject to great fluctuations, but they bring ready money
    to the community every month in the
    year. The old days when the farmer
    had either to deprive himself and his
    family of many comforts or else go
    in debt awaiting the season for his
    crops to ripen ire gone by. If he
    takes advantage of his opportunities,
    he has always a source of income
    which he can depend upon with absolute certainity. As upon the welfare
    of the farmer is founded the welfare
    of the State, as upon his prosperity
    depends the prosperity of every class
    in the community, it is of no small advantage to Minnesota that it is no
    longer merely the world's bread
    basket but has evolved into the "Bread
    and Butter State."
    BETTER   USE GRADES.
    In the breeding of pure bred cattle one finds that there are a great
    many kinds of people in the world and
    after he has been in the business for
    a few years he begins to find that it
    is the fellow who changes his politics
    every presidential election who is repeatedly changing breeds of cattle and
    his cheapness in politics also is noticeable in his selection of cattle. You
    can mark him before he gets to the
    farm for he usually writes a few letters asking the price on the best animals in the herd and after he has worn
    out his subject on paper he comes to
    the breeder and wants to see the cows
    that he has priced and his correspondence has been so voluminous that he
    imagines that he is the only one who
    is after cattle and he goes over his
    story and repeats everything he" has
    said and when shown the cattle he
    wants the best in the herd and he
    wants them at a price just one third
    lower than is asked for the most inferior animal in the herd. He lingers
    around and if he buys at all he ends
    by taking the poorest animal he can
    find and takes it home and tells all
    the neighbors of the great purchase
    he has made and the neighbors wait
    to see him change again in a year
    or more and make a failure out of
    the next breed he tries.
    Such men are a detriment to the
    cattle business and breeding business
    in general and they had better invest
    their money in grades than to tackle
    a business that they know nothing
    about and are too obstinate to learn.

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    9
    What a contrast the fellow pictured above it with the man who comes
    into a breeders herd and says, "I want
    a few animals of the very best breeding you have and I want to make a
    foundation for a herd of pure bred
    cattle." The former never succeeds
    and the latter invariably does.
    pie of the State is being faithfully and
    intelligently carried out.
    FAIR MANAGEMENT.
    It is not unlikely that at the next
    meeting of the Minnesota legislature
    steps will be taken to re-organize the
    management of the State fair, and to
    provide for its affairs that supervision
    which circumstances indicate to be
    necessary. The revenues of the fair
    are now so large and it has developed
    into so important a State institution
    that it is due to the people that adequate and efficient machinery be provided for the conduct of its affairs.
    The fair is presumably designed to
    recognize  and  to  encourage  the   industries  of the  State,  and to be an
    exposition of them.   Whether it fully
    serves that purpose, whether the proportion of its revenues devoted to it
    is as large as it should be, whether
    sufficient encouragement is   given  to
    the farmers and the farming communities  to  make  exhibits,  whether  the
    money paid in premiums outside of the
    State is Justified by the  educational
    value to the agricultural  population,
    whether the fair is too great an extent made a sporting carnival for the
    benefit  of  amusement  lovers  of the
    twin cities, whether all are accorded
    equal privileges and required to make
    equal   contributions   towards   its   revenues, whether there are or are not
    people who because of their intimate
    relations with the officers of the board
    are granted special favors—all these
    are questions in which the people of
    the State are interested and on which
    they   should   have  full  information.
    When   the  fair's  management  is  responsible to no one this information
    is at present unattainable.    It is not
    ment to intimate here that there is
    anything wrong with  the  State  fair
    management, or that the men connected with it are not entirely unselfish
    and   are  exerting  themselves   purely
    for the benefit of the public.   But the
    situation is one men could easily take
    advantage of, and our plea is for responsible fair    management, a much
    wider publicity of its affairs, and that
    official supervision of them which the
    public has  a right to  demand.    The
    people want not merely a successful
    fair where they can be entertained for
    a few days in the year if they pay the
    price.    Private  enterprise  could  furnish that.    They want even more, to
    know that a great public institution is
    used to serve private ends but that the
    purpose for which it was designed of
    encouraging and being a faithful exposition of the industries of the peo-
    GREETING TO NEW READERS.
    This issue of Heatwole's Dairy Paper will go into the hands of hundreds
    of new readers this month and it is to
    be hoped that some of these new
    readers will be added to the regular
    list and that they will want to have
    it a regular monthly visitor In the
    future. The paper is young yet and
    was not started with the idea that
    it was to be the only dairy paper in
    existence hut to fill a vacancy in the
    northwest. There is always a demand
    in the great northwest for good dairy
    literature and it is hoped that those
    who receive this number will feel
    that there is room for a paper of its
    size and general make-up at the extremely low price of only FIFTY
    CENTS FOR THREE YEARS. The
    paper is sent to only those who sud-
    scribe for it and it is always discontinued at the end of the time for
    which it is paid.
    The paper is edited by a practical
    dairy farmer who is actually living
    on the farm and helps with every
    branch of the work about the dairy. It
    will thus be seen that what comes
    from Heatwole's Dairy Paper must be
    practical and worthy of the consideration of its readers. The paper only
    comes once a month and for this reason the busy farmer always has time
    to look at it. If you are not now a
    subscriber send at once fifty cents
    either in two cent stamps or postal
    order and you will receive the paper
    for the next three years.
    cows in his herd that are high up on
    legs and believes that his animals of
    the future should be nearer the ground
    he should see to it that the sire he
    selects is one of the low down type
    , and one that will he more of the
    I type he desires to breed. He should
    ! look well to the vigor and constitution of the animal and see that he
    gets; one that will get good strong
    offspring.
    When the right animal is found
    there is no such a thing as paying
    too much for him. Nine out of ten
    good hulls are sold too cheap. How
    often do those who are breeding care
    to pay over twice as much for a sire
    as a cow and yet they expect to have
    this sire better the condition of the
    herd for the next three or four or even
    five years to come. Keep only the
    best sire possible to head your herd
    and then gradually get rid of the
    poorer cows and keep fewer and better animals and your profits will be
    very materially increased.
    THE PRICE OF A GOOD DAIRY SIRE
    At this season of the year nearly
    every good dairyman is looking to
    find a good sire to head his herd and
    if they would all look to quality instead of to price there would not be
    one-half enough good bulls to go
    around. There is by far too little
    thinking done by the average man
    who purchases a sire to head his
    herd. There is but one qualification
    looked at by many and that is that
    he must be a full blood and when
    they have this they are of the opinion
    that they have it all in a nutshell when
    the fact of the matter is that they
    have only begun to think about the
    breeding business and that they are
    too often going backwards. We do
    not wish to be understood as saying
    that a pure bred sire is not better
    than the scrub for he is. But there
    is a vast difference In pure bred sires
    and there are points that should be
    looked into and considered thoroughly before the purchase is made. There
    is the matter of type. Every breeder
    should have a type of animal that is
    his ideal and he should choose a sire
    with the end in view to perpetuate
    that type.    If he has  a number of
    THE NORTHFIELD CONVENTION.
    The Minnesota State Dairymen's association will hold its thirtieth annual
    convention    at   Northfleld,    Tuesday,
    Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 21, 22
    and 23, 1908.   The membership as well
    as interest in this association is growing every year.    The dairy Industry
    in Minnesota is also growing year by
    year, the output    of   the    Minnesota
    creameries has now passed  the one
    hundred million mark In pounds, and
    the cash income to the farmers is upward of fifteen million dollars, and yet
    we   are   as   dairymen   not   producing
    more   than   two-thirds   of   what   we
    should from the number of cows kept.
    Every dairyman should  attend the
    Northfield convention and hear talks
    from the best authorities on feeding,
    breeding, how to organize a cow testing     association;     the     co-operative
    creamery   vs.   the   centralizer,   both
    sides  will be  argued;   report of  the
    committee on co-operative selling and
    what has been done, and many other
    good things—you cannot afford to miss
    it.   A butter and cheese scoring contest will he an important feature of the
    convention.    Butter will be in three
    classes,  whole  milk  creamery,  hand
    separator creamery and dairy butter;
    cheese, American full cream, brick and
    Switzer. Liberal premiums will be given.   The only entry fee for this contest  is  a  membership   costing  $1.00,
    proceeds from    sale    of butter    and
    cheese will be returned to owner less
    freight.
    Don't forget the dates and don't
    forget to come. Northfleld will give
    us a royal entertainment for they
    know how to do things there and th6
    parties who have charge of arrangements, have guaranteed us the best
    time we ever had. Everybody will be
    taken care of. —Secretary.

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    F   I
    BURNING STRAW STACKS.
    The west will soon see the time,
    if it has not already, when the burning of straw stacks must be discontinued if the fertility of the land is
    to be kept up. It is almost a crime to
    look over the horizon in the fall of
    the year and see the numerous fires
    that indicate to the observer so much
    wealth gone up in smoke. There are
    men who seem to go on the assumption that there is no end to the fertility of the soil in this western country; but they will soon realize that
    there is an end and that end will
    come too when they are not aware
    of it and the value of their farms will
    be reduced fifty per cent and then it
    will he to borrow money to purchase
    fertilizer and work for many years
    to bring it back to the present state of
    fertility.
    If the straw stack cannot be made
    better use of it should be placed in
    the barn yard where the cattle can
    run over it and make it into fertilizer.
    There are some who say that their
    farms are already too rich, upon which
    to grow grain, if they are manured
    with barnyard manure and to those
    we will say that it is high time that
    this fertilizer be applied to the corn
    ground and to the pastures. There
    is no piece of land that is too fertile
    to grow good corn and there is a
    need of a whole lot of fertilizer on
    the pastures of the west. Do not burn
    the straw. Better pile it up and let
    it rot a few years and you will have
    the fertilizer when you are in need
    of it.
    The time is not far distant when
    you will be calling for more fertility
    as every time a farmer sells a ton
    of wheat he sells $11.62 in fertility;
    in a ton of alfalfa hay, he sells $8.63
    in fertility; in a ton of oats, he sells
    $7.81 in fertility, and in a ton of corn
    he sells $6.47 in fertility. If these products be fed on the farm and the manure and straw returned to the soil
    there is practically no loss.
    FEEDING FRESH COWS.
    Feeding fresh milking cows is a
    subject that is quite pertinent just at
    this time of the year when nearly all
    good dairymen are having an abundance of them. But before we take up
    the matter of feeding fresh cows it
    would be well to say a little about
    feeding the cows before they are
    fresh. Too many farmers and dairymen go on the assumption that when
    a cow is dry she needs no grain feed
    and here is where they are making a
    big mistake as the cow is then to be
    fitted for her next milking period. She
    should be made dry for at the least
    six weeks and after she is thoroughly
    dry she should be fed liberally on
    good  protien feeds    such  as  ground
    oats, bran, oil meal, etc., so that she
    may have the strength to go through
    her period of calving and be in good
    condition to give a large flow of milk
    for the following ten months. Some
    will say that that is a good way to
    produce milk fever, but if the cow is
    properly cared for when she comes
    in there is not the slightest danger
    of this. When she freshens do not
    milk her entirely out for two or three
    days if her udder seems to contain
    considerable fever. Just take out a
    little at a time and gradually bring
    her to her normal flow of milk.
    When a cow is cared for and fed
    in the above manner she will in a few
    days come to her milk in good shapp
    with but very little feed and the feeder should see to it that his cow does
    not get too much feed at this time as
    there is danger of over feeding and
    if this done she will not do her best
    this period. Try to keep her milk
    flow ahead of her feed and when the
    feed is increased little by little weigh
    the milk and see that she is making
    good use of the feed you are giving
    her. It is an utter impossibility to
    feed cows intelligently without weighing the milk every milking at least
    for a month after the cow has freshened for there is no way of telling
    what she is doing. After the capacity of the cow has been determined
    it is very easy to feed her.
    DISTRICT   BREEDERS   MEET.
    Stock and Plant Breeders of the Third
    District  Organize  at   Faribault.
    The breeders of all kinds of livestock in the Third Congressional drs-
    tarict met at Faribault on Tuesday,
    the 17th instant and organized an
    Animal and Plant Breeders association. There was a good attendance
    by the breeders from the different
    counties of the district and a very interesting meeting was held. Prof.
    Boss of the State experimental farm
    was instrumental in getting the breeders together and before the forming of
    a permanent organization the following topics were discussed:
    The Dairy Interests of the Third
    District—Hon. J. R. Morley, Owatonna.
    How and Why I Raise Poland China
    Swine.—O. F. Henkel, Kenyon.

    Management of a Milking Herd—W.
    F. Schilling, Northfield.
    How Can We Get Better Use from
    Our Pure Bred Sires.—Prof. A. Boss,
    St. Anthony Park.
    After the discussion of the program
    there was much sentiment in favor of
    a permanent organization and a constitution and by-laws were drawn up and
    adopted and the following officers were
    Warriner's
    Chain-
    Hanging

    Prof. R. D- Shaw,
    of Michigan Agricultural college, writes: "The Warrin-

    Although the calf may drink from
    the pail the first time it is placed before it, it is always best to give it
    the finger for a time or two as it will
    then learn to take the milk by sucking
    it down and will not gulp it down and
    be troubled with indigestion and later
    subject to scours.

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    U
    SILO   AND   SOFT   CORN.
    Farmers   who   Built   This   Year   Are
    Reaping  Harvest.
    All last summer we urged our
    readers to provide themselves with a
    silo, if possible; and we think we can
    realize the solid satisfaction that those
    of them who were willing and in shape
    to take our advice now enjoy, says
    Wallace's Farmer.
    In many sections of our territory
    the corn was injured by frost. Many
    farmers, anticipating this, put their
    corn in the silo before it occurred.
    Others, knowing from reading and experience that even frosted corn made
    good silage, continued to cut it. The
    farmer who has plenty of clover hay
    and plenty of good silage and good
    cows, with suitable stabling, is not
    complaining now and will not complain. He will make quite as much
    money this year as he has ever made
    from his dairy cows.
    The farmer who did not have a silo
    and has frosted corn is now puzzling
    his brain to know how to feed it to
    the best advantage. So long as the
    weather keeps mild and corn does not
    freeze solid he gets practically all
    there is in this frosted corn; but
    when cold weather comes and the soft
    corn which should have gone to the
    silo is frozen solid and hence becomes
    indigestible, he will be dissatisfied
    with the results, whether it be fed to
    dairy cows or fattening hogs.
    The farmer who has a silo will find
    the work of feeding much more satisfactory during the cold months ot
    winter than he did when he had to
    haul corn, the bundles often frozen
    to the ground, with the snow drifting
    and the thermometer ten degrees
    below zero.
    We speak of this now because we
    are anxious that next year our readers who are engaged more or less in
    dairying shall take measures to provide themselves with a silo of some
    kind and at the same time provide
    proper shelter for all the live stock
    to which it is fed. We have not
    urged our readers who are engaged
    in feeding cattle, or in keeping stackers through the winter, to provide
    themselves with silos. We believe
    they can do so to advantage provided
    they have proper shelter. The place
    to begin to use the silo is with the dairy cow, and then feel your way toward feeding it to other kinds of live
    stock with profit and advantage.
    Heatwole's Dairy Paper wants to
    get photographs of the best dairy
    herds in the country. If you have a
    good one send it in at once and on the
    back of the same be sure to write
    plainly your name and address, the
    name of the farm, the kind of stock
    kept and whether pure bred or grades.

    CREAM CHECKS ABOVE PAR.
    To Encourage Patrons They Will Give
    Premium of 10 Per Cent.
    That Osakis business men are ever
    ready to assist in every possible way
    any enterprise that tends to benefit
    the village and farming community,
    and will donate liberally to its maintenance and success, was never better
    demonstrated than by the action taken this week to encourage the undivided support of the home creamery
    by dairymen and farmers. This time
    of year many creameries shut down
    owing to the light run of cream, but |
    it is the desire of the Osakis business |
    men to make the local creameries
    an all-year-around success, and to
    that end they have hit upon the
    unique plan of offering a 10 per cent
    premium on all cream checks issued
    by the Osakis creamery. As an illustration, if you have a creamery check
    issued by Manager N. I. Hugger for $5
    any of the following business houses
    of Osakis will honor the check in the
    sum of $5.50 when presented in exchange for goods: Osakis Hardware
    Co., A. J. Caugren & Co., E. H. Er-
    ickson, George Herberger, Wm. Lenz,
    G. E. Lamphear, C. S. French, J. J.
    Skuey, Osakis Drug Co.
    The premium placed on cream
    checks issued by the Osakis creamery
    means that the patrons of the local
    creamery will receive 3c per pound
    above the New York market price
    for their cream.   To this may he added
    the 2c a pound premium received by
    Mr. Hugger for his entire output of
    butter, making 5c above normal market price.
    No Better Exponent.
    A copy of Heatwole's Dairy Paper
    has found its way to our exchange
    table. It is a very creditable production and covers its field in good shape.
    There is no lack of farm papers in
    Minnesota and some of them are excellent publications. But we doubt
    whether a better exponent of the dairy
    interests of the State can be found
    than this paper of Mr. Heatwole's.
    Like everything else that comes from
    the Northfield News shop it is neat in
    appearance and thoroughly up to date.
    —Minneota Mascot.
    Room for Improvement.
    Heatwole's Dairy Paper has started
    a campaign which seeks to make the
    State fair more of a dairying exhibition than that which it now is—simply
    an exhibition of fat cattle and used
    in the interests of the meat trust. The
    position of the paper is well taken and
    there is a lot of room for improvement
    in the distribution of prizes for the
    dairying industry. It is to be hoped
    that every paper in the State will use
    its influence in creating a sentiment
    along the line that the State Fair association cannot well overlook.—Dassel Anchor.

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    HOG CHOLERA AT HANLEY FALLS
    Hundreds of Hogs Have Already Been
    Taken  by This  Disease.
    Cholera is killing off the hogs in
    the vicinity of Hanley Falls, the losses in each instance ranging all the
    way from twenty to seventy. It is
    said that the disease has been prevalent in that vicinity for the past two
    months and that its spread has been
    caused in part, no doubt, by negligence.
    The State veterinarian was called to
    investigate the matter, says the Hendricks Pioneer of last week.
    . In regard to hog cholera and swine
    plague the revised laws of 1905 provide as follows:
    Sec. 5011. Diseased animals—disposal of carcasses, etc.—Every person
    owning or having in charge any domestic animal that has died or been
    killed on account of disease shall immediately bury the carcass thereof at
    least four feet deep in the ground or
    cause same to be consumed by fire.
    No person shall sell, offer to sell, or
    give away such carcass when the animal died or was killed on account of
    disease nor convey the same upon any
    public road or upon any land not his
    own. Nor shall any person negligently or willfully permit diseased animals owned or controlled by him to
    e-icape his control or to run at large.
    Every violation of any provision of
    this section shall be a misdemeanor.
    Sec. 2165. Offences and penalties—
    Every person violating any provision
    of this chapter, or any rule or regulation made hereunder by the State
    board or any local board of health, or
    any order made by either under the
    authority of this chapter, shall be
    guilty of a misdemeanor, the minimum punishment whereof shall be a
    fine of twenty-five dollars, or imprisonment thirty days.
    Hog cholera and swine plague resemble each other, and as both are
    equally contagious, the same measures
    must be used in prevention and control. When several hogs die within a
    short time, it may be safely assumed
    that the cause is due to either hog
    cholera or swine plague, or both diseases at the same time and the following instructions should be closely followed:
    Report the matter at once to the
    health board of your township.
    Bury or burn at once all hogs which
    have died   of  any  disease.
    Confine the hogs to enclosures remote from the public highway.
    Disinfect hog pens and enclosures
    by sprinkling with the following solution; carbolic acid, crude 1 lb. to
    five gallons water, or air slacked lime
    instead may be used daily.
    Hogs should be kept in dry pens.
    Dogs must, be tied up as they carry
    the disease.

    Wagons or hog racks used to remove
    dead hogs must not be taken on a
    neighbor's farm.
    Only the one whose duty it is to feed
    the animals should be allowed near
    the pen, this attendant to keep away
    from neighbor's hogs.
    As preventive measures when the
    disease exists in the neighborhood
    the following precautions should be
    observed:
    Do not visit your neighbor's hog
    pens or enclosures, nor allow any unauthorized person to go into your
    own hog pens or enclosures.
    Keep  your  dog tied up.
    Do not allow your hogs to run
    about, keep them in small dry pens or
    enclosures.
    Give the hogs a small quantity of
    carbolic acid in feed or water, 3 to
    15 drops, according to age. This will
    keep the feeding troughs disinfected
    and will have a tendency to check the
    development of the germs.
    In buying and selling hogs for
    breeding purposes they should be
    crated and expressed, as the law explicitly states that no hog may be taken from a stockyard except for immediate slaughter.
    Breeding hogs shipped in from another point should be kept apart for
    at least two weeks before being placed
    with other animals of its own kind.
    If an outbreak of the disease has
    been experienced, no fresh hogs may
    be permitted to be brought into the
    infected premises until six months
    after the last hog has died or recovered.
    Do not think that your hogs are immune from either of these diseases,
    and every effort should be made to
    follow out the abovo instructions, ae
    they are for your benefit.
    Intelligent prevention is much more
    satisfactory than treatment.
    Some winter   is    always    sent   to
    those who have a great work to do.

    GOODHUE FARMERS CLUB.
    Bigger   Production   and    Increase   in
    Number of Farms.
    There are certain things especially
    to be desired and sought for in connection with agriculture, says the
    Press committee oi the Goodhue
    Farmers club in the Kenyon Leader.
    First—That the number of farmers
    should be increased. Almost ail other
    workers are jealous of competition
    and of being crowded in their work
    and of having the supply of labor
    greater than the demand, thus reducing wages. But there is no such feeling among the farmers. The life of
    the world depends upon their labor,
    and it is hardly possible to raise
    more crops than the world can consume. Minnesota is pre-eminently an
    agricultural State, and her farmers are
    numbered by the tens of thousands.
    But there is room for more. The newcomer will be welcomed. He can not
    possibly harm the farmers nor reduce
    the price of their farm products, because a hungry world is waiting for
    all that we can produce.
    Second—But even more important
    than the increase in the number of
    farmers by immigration into the State,
    either from other States or foreign
    countries, is the selection of farming
    as their occupation by the families,
    the sons and daughters of the farmers—in other words, loyalty of the
    country people to country life.
    It is a very important problem how
    to maintain a proper balance between
    the country and the cities. Many
    country lads go to the cities and become most important factors in developing the business of the cities.
    Very few city boys go to the country,
    and those who do are not generally
    remarkable for their success in farming. It is almost necessary for the
    health of the country that there
    should be a constant infusion of country blood and vigor into city life.
    But it is not desirable that there
    should be too much of this. Agriculture is in a large sense the life of our
    country. It is desirable that a large
    percentage of country boys should
    stick to the farm. I am quite sure
    that those who do will stand a better
    chance of success and be far more certain of independence and happiness
    than most of them would if they
    should try their fortunes in the city.
    i^M
    Should Be Remedied.
    The current issue of Heatwole's
    Dairy Paper of Northfield contends
    that the State Fair association is giving undue attention and showing partiality to the beef producing interests,
    while the great dairy interests of the
    State suffer accordingly. It is held
    that as Minnesota is more interested
    in the raising of dairy cattle, dairy
    stockmen  ought  to  at least have  a

    fair show with beef stockmen at the
    State fair. The Dairy Paper says premiums aggregating $2,500 were won by
    a breed of beef cattle while barely a
    fifth of that amount was extended for
    the encouragement of a breed of animals in which the people of the State
    are most vitally interested. For a
    commonwealth known as the "Bread
    and Butter State" this showing does
    surely seem to be contrary to what
    ought to be naturally expected. Heatwole's Dairy Paper intimates very
    strongly that the fair association is
    controlled by wrong interests to give
    all a fair show. If this be so, steps
    ought to be taken with no unnecessary
    delay to remedy the matter, as no
    suspicion of gratifying the special interests of any class to the detriment
    or injury of another should be given
    jrounds for existence.—Houston County Chief.

    Take a gallon of pure water, hard
    or soft, and to every gallon of water
    needed to cover the meat add 1V4 lbs.
    salt, % lb. sugar and % oz. saltpeter.
    Place meat in a barrel and weight
    down before pouring on the brine,
    which must be cold, with all of the
    ingredients well dissolved. After it
    has been in the brine 2 to 4 weeks lift
    out and hang in a smokehouse a day
    or two to dry, before smoking. Clean
    odorless wood should be used for
    smoking any meat, and the smoke
    should be conducted to the smoke
    room through a channel or flue from a
    fire built outside and 6 to 8 feet away.
    Smoke until the outside of pieces are
    a nice light brown or a good tan color.
    Bacon so cured, cut thin and fried or

    Can Well\nAfford  to  Study.\nCan you find the mora! in the following camparison
    of figures?\n1 ton of hay equals 400 cubic feet.\n8 tons silage equals 400 cubic
    feet.\n1 ton hay equals 1,680 pounds dry\nmatter.\n8 tons silage equals 3.360
    pounds\ndry   matter.\n1 ton hay equals 886 pounds digestible nutrients.\n8 tons
    silage equals 2,094 pounds\ndigestible nutrients.\nThose who feed stock in any
    kind of\nthoughtful way are no doubt familiar\nwith the many advantages of silage\nover
    hay, yet in the above light there\nis a striking comparison in which the\ntwo
    feeds are measured by three\nstandards. The hay and silage each\nrepresent about
    the yield of half an\nacre.\nIn the first instance the space\nwhich each feed
    occupies is compared.\nHay being bulky requires 400 cubic\nfeet for one ton. Eight
    tons of silage\ncan be stored in the same space. Suppose that in place of building
    barns\nand hay sheds, silos were substituted.\nThe storage space could be reduced\njust
    exactly to one-eighth, according\nto the above. Think of the economy\nthereby
    resulting—less original expense and less incidentals such as annual repair, painting,
    etc.\nWe have heard it said that silage\nlacked body; that it was washy and\nconsequently
    contained little nourishment. But note the comparison. One\nton matter as an equal
    volume of silage. By dry matter is meant the feed\nless the moisture it contains.
    Hay ordinarily in a state to Keep well, contains about twenty or thirty per cent\nmoisture,
    while of silage about half\nthe weight is water. This large\namount of water in
    silage is what\ngives it succulence, which in turn\nmakes for palatability—a feature\nwhich
    makes silage so valuable when\nonly dry feed is available.\nThe digestible nutriment
    in any\nfood indicates its real value. Not all\nof the flesh-forming or fat-forming
    elements found in foods are available or\nin other words digestible. Thus in\nthe
    above table it will be seen that\nthe per cent of digestible nutriments\nin hay
    is much lower than in silage.\nThis fact enhances the value of silage still more.
    By comparison of\nequal volumes of the two feeds, hay\nsupplies less than one-half
    as much\ndigestible nutrient as silage.\nThe comparison could be carried\nfurther
    if desired, and figures given to\nshow the superiority of silage, on account of
    its succulence, over dry feeds.\nIn experiments it has been found\nthat corn in

    on\nthe market.\nThink of the combination!—Just the two\nthings in a manure spreader
    the farmer has\nalways wanted.\nThe wise ones said it couldn't be done.\nI've
    disappointed them.\nFirst—they said a wagon-box\nspreader wouldn't work.—My hundreds
    of well satisfied customers\nhave already stopped that talk.\nThen—when it came
    to an endless apron force feed machine—\nthey said, \"impossible\". Did you\nhave
    free mail delivery, telephone\nor a cream separator ten years ago ?\nNothing is
    impossible! You will\nsay so when you see how simple\nand how wonderfully effective
    my\ngreat new improvement is.\nIt is simply turning the spreader\nbusiness right
    end to and giving the\nfarmer a chance.\nEvery farmer can afford a Galloway Wagon-Box
    Spreader.\nI want every farmer in the United\nStates to own one.\nThat's why I
    sell it direct to you, saving you\nevery cent.    (Tell your neighbors.)\nRight
    at the start I am selling this machine\nfor $59 SO, freight prepaid. At retail
    it would\ncost you $75.00. I also save you tying up $50.00 to\n$70.00 in a spreader
    truck useless eleven\nmonths in the year.\nMy guarantee is the broadest possible—I\nback
    it up to show you that I mean business by\na $25,000 legal bond.\nThen to absolutely
    convince you I say, \"try\none  of my spreaders for 30 days on my free\nWilliam
    Galloway,\nBuilder of the Only Endless\nApron Force Feed Manure\nSpreader in the
    World.\nplan.\" Let me send you one to take out in the\nfield to use, or abuse
    if you want to, for 30\ndays. If it's not worth more than my price—\ntake it to
    the depot—ship it back—and I'll return your money.\nWhy not get everything that's
    coming to you\nout of your land? That manure heap outside\nof your barn will buy
    my spreader twice over\nfor you.\nEvery farmer has been saying,—\"I   must   [f\nown
    a spreader.\"\nForty-nine out of fifty say the old\nstyle horse-killing machine
    is too\nhigh in price.   Isn't that a fact?\nNow, I claim the Galloway is\nright

    letyou be convinced by\nthe machine itself, without Bending\nme a cent? I'll do
    it today if you\nwill write me.\nI have just this further clincher\nto offer you.
    For a limited time I\nwill make a proposition to the Hist\nfarmer owning a Galloway
    Spreader\nin every community whereby lie can\npartly or entirely pay for his machine
    without\na bit of work done. It'-s a strictly business\nproposition and will positively

    EDITORIAL  NOTES.
    There is now and probably will be
    for some years to come a shortage in
    the crop of lambs and the price of
    mutton will be on the increase The
    cutting up of the ranges will drive
    the sheep industry into the farmers'
    hands and the sooner this is done the
    sooner the noxious weed problem will
    be solved. Every farmer should keep
    a few sheep.
    * *     *
    It is now high time to be thinking
    about breeding the cows so that they
    will be good milkers next rail and
    winter. Are you going to keep in
    the line of scrubs and use a scrub
    sire or are you going to get out of
    the rut? Read the advertisements of
    the reliable breeders in Heatwole's
    Dairy Paper and wrile them if you
    want to improve yom stocit.
    * *     •
    TJ. L. Lashbrock sold a pure bred
    Holstein-Friesian sire to J. F. De-
    Wolfe at Barron, Wis., recently.
    There are not over thirty pure bred
    sires of this breed within Barron
    county and the farmers are g.«ing to
    show the northwest a trick in dairying in a few years that will startle
    the older dairy sections. They already have the banner creamery in
    the northwest and last year made
    more butter than any other creamery
    in the three States adjoining.
    * •     •
    There is  a possibility of the  next
    National Dairy Show being held in
    Madison Square Garden, New York
    city. Milwaukee is also after the
    great show. There are a few millionaire farmers that want New York,
    but the rank and file of dairymen
    would   prefer    some    more    central
    point.
    * *     •
    Remember the annual dairy convention of the Minnesota State Dairymen's Association is to be held at
    Northfield, January 21st to 23rd. Plan
    to attend as there will be a good program.
    * • •
    Farmers attending the dairy convention in Northfield next month are
    invited to inspect the stock and dairy
    buildings at Spring Brook farm only
    one mile distant from town.
    * •     *
    Do not feed the cow simply to see
    how much milk you can get out of
    her, but feed her with good farm
    grown grains and see that she keeps
    healthy and strong and produces a
    good calf each year. Ground oats
    cannot be excelled as a food for cows.
    * *     *
    When a man tells you that he has
    a cow testing five or six per cent in
    butter fat you do not know any more
    about the cow than you did before
    he made the remark. Ask him how
    many pounds of this kind of milk he
    gets from her daily and you will soon
    be able to figure out her value in the
    dairy. May be a three per cent or
    a three-two cow would beat her.
    * * •
    The packers have been manipulating the pork market during the past
    few weeks to their own advantage.
    This up-today and way-down-tomorrow scheme will soon get the farmers
    to thinking and it will not be many
    years before there will be co-operative
    packing plants in the northwest and
    all will welcome the day when these
    arrive. Denmark was driven to this
    many years ago to protect her agricultural interests and America will have
    to get in line as it did with the successful  co-operative creamery.
    * *     •
    W. B. Barney, the popular • breeder
    of Holstein-Friesian cattle at Hamp-
    ton, Iowa, has just been re-elected
    president of the Iowa Dairymen's Association. Mr. Barney is a very capable and efficient officer and has the
    dairy interests of his State always at
    heart. The association is to be congratulated upon its selection.
    * * *
    Neighborhood or community breeding of one kind of stock is gaining
    ground every day. It tends to bring
    neighbors closer together and they
    spend more time with their stock and
    find a greater interest in their work.
    Get this work to going in your neighborhood and see how it will interest
    the boys.
    «     *     *
    The dairy farmer has always got
    something to do in the winter. If
    you see a farmer hanging around town
    all afternoon and at milking time you
    can safely bet that he is a poor dairyman.
    * • •
    Fred Cramer, of Mapleton, Minn., recently purchased a choice young sire
    and four heifers at Spring Brook farm.
    The young sire was from a twenty
    pound dam and is not only a well
    bred youngster, but a splendid individual as well. At the Holstein show
    in a class of eleven bulls this fall he
    was given the championship. Mr. Cramer has the foundation for a very good
    herd.
    ■     •     •
    TJ. L. Lashbrook sold a fine heifer
    calf to Fayette Lee, of Cokato, Minn.,
    last week. Mr. Lee contemplates
    founding a Holstein herd.
    * •     •
    A pretty good example of how some
    folks get mixed on dairy type was exhibited at a recent public sale where
    a number of almost pure bred Shorthorn cows offered and a beginner
    in the dairy business purchased three
    of these aniamls to use in a dairy
    where a large persistent flow of milk
    was wanted. He got his eyes opened
    shortly after getting them home, but
    that was too late—his cash was spent.
    Oldest Dairy School.
    In a historical work on the province
    of Barndenberg, Germany, there is a
    description of the draining of a certain swamp district and the establishing by King Fredeick Wilhelm I of
    a large dairy farm run on the Dutch
    system with Freisian cows imported
    in 1719 and 1721. This was made virtually a dairy school for butter and
    cheesemakers to which the farmers'
    daughters were sent to perfect themselves in the management of a dairy
    farm. The term was two years of service after which they had to make butter without help. This was often
    judged by his majesty and if found
    good the maids received a dowery of
    100 thaler ($240).
    King Frederick II kept it up for a
    time but, after a while, he turned over
    most of the land as pasture for fattening imported cattle and added a stable
    of fine horses. Finally he returned to
    his father's old plan and re-established
    the "academy for dairy maids" in 1780
    with a Hollander, Thomas Harms, as
    manager, and his three daughters as
    teachers. After the death of Harms
    his daughters continued the "school"
    into the next century but it was less
    and less patronized.
    With all its fine name of "academy"
    I suspect the teachings were pretty
    slim and that the old king simply used
    it as a trap to secure the free service
    of the robust farmers daughters for
    two years. No wonder he could afford
    to give "dowries" as premiums.
    Hard on  Creameries.
    The newspapers throughout the
    State are pleading long and earnestly
    with the farmers to stand by the horns
    creameries. They are presenting arguments based upon facts and figures
    but in spite of all they can do the
    creameries are receiving scant patronage. The LeSueur News says anent
    this subject.
    "The creamery is going fast. You
    may talk to the farmers of your vicinity and learn this. You can do 80
    right here at LeSueur.
    "The centralization of creameries
    and the shipping of milk and cream
    is turning the trick. The farmers who
    give away to the plan will live to regret it if the same thing is true in
    this line that it is all through life.
    We refer to what happens after the
    competition is wiped out. Stop and
    think for a moment. All summer
    when milk and cream was plentiful,
    your home creamery was able to compete with the city house, was it not?
    Now when the pastures are turning
    brown and feed is very high the city
    house pays up a notch and is patronized. What is the result? The profit,
    if any of the summer must be thrown
    away because the patronage will not
    pay the expense of operation.    Later

    HEATWOLE'S DAIRY PAPER
    your creamery will shut down for the
    winter months, as many have, and
    then learn they cannot secure a competent buttermaker for a short time
    in the summer. Finally the home
    creamery quits. Dies for want of
    patronage.   Then what happens?"
    A   FOOL   SIENTIST.
    Reginald Overocker was a trial to
    his mother. Mrs. Overocker had unbounded respect for wealth and sought
    to train her son to esteem ail roads to
    wealth, including marriage. The son
    cared nothing for wealth and was absorbed in the sciences. Everybody
    knows that there is nothing cheaper
    than brains and nothing more profitable than a knack for getting rich. This
    is the reason that Mrs. Overocker lamented that her son insisted on wasting his time on chemistry, geology,
    astronomy, biology—indeed, every
    science ending in y.
    But when one day the young man
    told his mother that he was engaged
    to Lucy Le Roy, who had come of
    age and into possession of a large estate at the same time, Mrs. Overocker
    was much molified. She embraced her
    son half a dozen times and told him
    he might waste his time with his sciences to his heart's content.
    There was one difficulty in the way
    of Miss Le Roy's peaceable possession
    of the Le Roy estates. Her grandfather had accumulated tnem, and as her
    lather, Henry Le Roy, had married
    her mother contrary to the old Le-
    Roy's wishes, dying he had left all
    the property to Peter Le Roy, his
    only other child, Miss Le Roy's uncle.
    Peter disappointed the old man by
    leading a wild, roving life and had
    twenty-five years before been last
    heard of in South America. From that
    time he had not troubled her brother
    or her brother's family, who at the
    old man's death had entered into
    peaceable possession of the estate.
    But, then, supposed-to-be-dead people have an inconvenient way of turning up when least wanted, and the
    engagement of the young couple had
    scarcely been announced when notice
    was served on Miss Le Roy that her
    uncle Peter had returned and demanded his possessions. The blow was a
    severe one to Miss Le Roy and Mrs.
    Overocker. Reginald was engrossed
    in his scientific studies and experiments and did not seem to have common sense enough to take notice that
    he, a poor man, had pledged himself
    to marry a girl who at the end of a
    lawsuit—if she contested the claim—
    would likely be as penniless as himself. His want of appreciation of the
    fact was very annoying to his mother
    and correspondingly refreshing to his
    fiancee.
    He who claimed to be Peter Le Roy
    had long lived under the name of
    Frederick Briggs.    He had very little

    resemblance to the boyish pictures of
    Peter, but this was not surprising, as
    few people will easily recognize even
    a friend not seen in a quarter of a
    century. He secured the services of
    a lawyer with a talent for making
    the most of his points of evidence, and
    many people had no doubt that he
    was the real Peter. However, Miss
    Le Roy's counsel advised her to contest his claim on the ground that he
    was no one else than Frederick
    Briggs.
    It was well known that the real Peter Le Roy when a boy of eighteen
    had been hit in the temple with a
    baseball and had consequently lost
    the use of his right eye. Miss Le Roy's
    counsel relied on this fact to prove
    Briggs an imposter and ordered the
    man before an oculist for examination.
    Whether Briggs and his counsel
    knew what their opponet intended to
    gain by the examination and were
    prepared for their tests or whether the
    man was really blind in his right
    eye, the oculist was unable to prove
    that he could see with it. However,
    when the case was called and Briggs
    had brought the strongest possible
    proof that he was Peter Le Roy, Miss
    Le Roy's counsel introduced the oculist, who vainly tried by a number of
    tests to entrap the claimant into reading with his left eye closed. The trial
    had reached the climax, and Miss Le
    Roy was so wrought up over the
    probability of being reduced to poverty that she prevailed upon her studious lover to leave his sciences for
    one day and go to court with her. He
    sat in the court room evidently far
    away with some problem till the ocu
    list began his efforts to entrap the
    claimant. After that he was all attention. When the oculist failed Reginald whispered something to Miss Le
    Roy's counsel, then left the courtroom. In half an hour he returned
    and was called upon to examine the
    claimant's eyes. Giving the man a
    pair of spectacles to put on, Reginald
    held a black card before his eyes, on
    which were words written in green
    letters, and asked him to read them.
    This the claimant did without anw difficulty. Reginald glanced at Miss Le
    Roy's counsel, indicating that he was
    satisfied, and he was called on for
    the result of his test.
    "Of  these   glasses,"  he  said,   "the
    left is red,    the    right is    ordinary
    transparent glass. The red glass before what he admits is his sound eye
    combined with green letters produces
    black. In other words, through this
    glass he cannot see the letters at all.
    Consequently he read them with his
    right eye, which he claims is opaque."
    The judge looked at the jury, the
    jury looked at each other, the spectators tittered, the oculist blushed,
    while Miss Le Roy beamed on her lover. Then the jury without leaving
    their seats found a verdict for the defendant, and the property remained in
    the hands of Miss Le Roy.
    When Reginald Overocker wa»
    praised for his shrewdness in unmasking the claimant's rascality he was
    puzzled. He couldn't understand why
    such a simple matter should inspire
    judge, jury, attorneys and a room full
    of spectators with wonder iwd admiration. However, since he was
    thereafter permitted to pursue his
    studies without the intereference of
    mother.
    Forget   It.
    If you see a tall fellow ahead of a
    crowd,
    A  leader  of  men   marching  fearless
    and   proud,
    And you know of a tale whose mere
    telling aloud
    Would   cause  his   proud   head  to   in
    anguish be bowed,
    It's a pretty good  plan to forget it.
    If  you   know  of   a  skeleton   hidden
    away
    In  a  closet,  and  guarded,  and  kept
    from the day
    In   the   dark;    and   whose   showing,
    whose sudden display
    Would   cause  grief  and   sorrow   and
    lifelong dismay,
    It's  a pretty good  plan to  forget it.
    If you know of a thing that will darken the joy
    Of a man or a woman, a girl or a
    boy,
    That will wipe out a smile, or the
    least way annoy
    A fellow, or cause any gladness to
    cloy,
    It's a pretty good plan to forget it.
    Since illuminated texts have become
    all the rage wouldn't this be a good
    one; "No doctor can cure what ails
    you.    It's your mean disposition."

    The BOSS FEED £
    LITTER CARRIER
    THIS is surely an age of invention and
    that there is no end of the different
    devices suggested £or the assistance
    of the farmer in doing his daily work goes
    without saying. The farm is the place
    where there is more labor than any other
    occupation and to arrange to do this labor
    at the least possible cost is the constant
    aim. The heaviest work on the farm in
    the winter months is that of cleaning out
    the cow stables and the farmer who keeps
    a good herd of cattle cannot afford to be
    without a feed and litter carrier. And
    when getting one he should make it a point
    to get the very best on the market and this
    means to get a Boss Carrier. And why?
    Because it is invented and patented by a
    farmer who had used others and has made
    all the improvements possible on such a
    device.
