descri: This board includes individual portraits of students from St. Cloud Hospital
  School of Nursing, Class of 1950 and Class of 1951. The photographs are black-and-white
  prints mounted on two cream colored paper boards, with identifications hand lettered
  in black ink. They are mounted on a large, brown paper board. The first training
  school for nurses in St. Cloud, Minnesota, opened at St. Raphael's Hospital (predecessor
  to St. Cloud Hospital) in September 1908, one year after the state legislature mandated
  that all nurses working in Minnesota hospitals be licensed. As did the hospital,
  the education program operated under the auspices of the Sisters of the Order of
  Saint Benedict in St. Joseph, Minnesota. From its inception until it closed in 1987,
  the school was conducted as a three-year diploma program that blended academic and
  practical training for the nursing profession. In 1964, the school began admitting
  male and married students. The large format photo composite boards were first created
  in 1958 by two graduates of the school, Lidwina Kray and Marian Town, as part of
  the St. Cloud Hospital School of Nursing Alumnae Association celebration of the
  school's 50th anniversary. The boards were displayed in a book-like frame that allowed
  viewers to page through the history of the school's students.  Each year following,
  graduating classes added their portraits to the 'book.' There are 50 boards in all.
