    My name is Ed Nelson and we're at the office of the Senior Reporter in Duluth,
    Minnesota. This is an interview with Naomi Silfversten, and Ruth Silfversten Coppins,
    petty Hamspen, Ruth and Naomi are sisters and they grew up in the West End of
    Duluth and your father's name was Carl J. Silfversten.
    Can you give me a background on where your father and mother were born and how
    they came to this country?
    My father was born in the Swedish section or part of Finland and the town was Narpes,
    Finland. Mother was born in Sweden, Skane. (with an umlaut, I think.)
    Mother's name?
    Ellen Benson.
    Wilen were they born?
    M9ther was born in 1883. I remember that. Because she was 95 just about 96 when she died
    and that was in 1979.
    Was your father older than your mother?
    Yes, about 4 years or so - so 1879.
    They immigrated - stories?
    Well, Dad was 19 years old when he came here and he wanted to go into the ministry
    eventually so he had to go to school and I believe he probably came from Rock Island or that
    area and I don't know much about the - after 19 I suppose he had to get - he had an education
    in Finland and they came here because he did get to Gustavus Adolphus College and from
    there he went to Theological Seminary; that was in Rockford. This is where he met Mother as
    she was a member ofthe church and the choir and they were married.
    Did he tell you about life in Finland?

    No but - well I'm quite sure he was a poor child and like so many immigrants because they
    wanted to get a better - have a better life so he was interested in becoming a minister and this
    was his goal to come to this country to study.
    Was his father a minister?
    No, his father was a captain ofthe high seas or a fisherman - a commercial fisherman on the
    gulfof 01 so Dad was sort of raised to be a fisherman when he was a child so Dad has
    written several books but he has that one that is a safe channel that he writes stories regarding
    the - ofthe days with his dad fishing.
    I am pretty sure I have that at home.
    I have that one too. And I don't have much on my mother's background. Apparently she was
    just a baby when she came here to this country.
    So your father was a Swede-Finn?
    Dad always said Finland Swede and - Swedes are born iii Finland and which is - I had made
    a trip there- it would be ten years this year and I visited the area where Dad was from and it's
    on the west coast - the GulfofB.? -and I don't know how many towns or cities are included
    in all ofthe west coast but it does go up quite a ways and I don't have that map with me. It's
    Finland and all outside on the west coast ofFinland.
    It was settled by Swedish people?
    Yes.
    Finnish government?
    I suppose they had to be. Part ofthe time they were undertheRussian - in 1917 then Finland
    declared its independence.
    Were they amongst Swedish speaking people?
    Oh yes the whole area is. Jim was on that trip too.
    When your father came here did he come by himself?
    I understand that.
    Any relatives?
    Not that I'm aware of. Not that we know.

    We had relatives way up in T., He didn't come over the same time she did and
    whether she was born over there or in this country - I don't know. That is the only known
    relative I can think of.
    When did he come here?
    1819.
    What did he do when he first came here?
    I suppose he had to go on in school, I don't know ifhe completed high school in Finland so
    called- he probably did but then he went to Gustavus College in the summer he used to - in
    fact he came to Duluth. I remember him telling us in 1905 and he worked on the coal docks
    in order to get some money for school and at that time he also - he didn't join but he would
    go to the Bethany Lutheran church in West End and I think he taught Saturday Bible School­something
    like that and ~ but and then from then he ofcourse
    When did he meet your mother?
    When they probably came to S.? in that area. I don't know much about them landing here. I
    know that she was - well he was at this church in Chicago because she was from Chicago and
    he met her at church naturally because he was interested in becoming a minister and she­mother
    was in the choir and so apparently the romance started that way and so they were
    married and then - married in Chicago.
    So he graduated from Gustavus and went on to Augustana Seminary in Rock Island, IL.
    Graduated?
    It must have been 1909 because it seemed to me they were married in 1909.... Church? The
    first church he was assigned to was in Worchester, Massachusetts, and then from there they
    moved to Gladstone, ML He was a SwedishlFinland minister. He had these churches that
    were Swede/Finn origin and then went to Gladstone, ML, went to Ironwood, Michigan, then
    to Rhinelander, WI and then ofcourse in 1920 he was called here to Bethel,
    Did he stay in Duluth?
    Yes until he passed away. He was the pastor ofthis church for 26 years.
    Where were you guys born?
    I was born in Ironwood.
    I was born in Rhinelander and our brother was born in Gladstone.

    What is your brother's name?
    Hilden?? And of course she was a twin and the other brother passed away when he was 19
    months old.
    Then the family moved to Duluth and that is where all-
    There was - this church had a parsonage down the block here and - so that. is where we were
    for a period oftime. I don't remember how long because at that time Dad decided he wanted
    to build his own home so he got some property up on Central Avenue so - but at that time
    mother took ill and she was an invalid from the time she was 40 years old until she died in
    1995. But nevertheless we managed to get along. They sold the parsonage and then we
    moved down to 53" this way temporarily until our house became livable or we could move
    in. So that is where we spent most ofour time.
    What do you remember about your ethnic group?
    I don't recall what we singled out -we chummed around with anyone and everybody. We
    had different nationalities. I can't say that we singled out the Swedes or Finns. A great part of
    our time was spent here at church. When we went to school or out to play it was all
    nationalities. But I think that we had a normal growing up as anybody else. Except that we
    were the minister's kids and you felt you had to be so good because your father was a
    minister.
    It is a lot different now. Even the ministers are different. It's kind ofnice because - you're
    something a little special. I don't know ifthey felt that way or not. We lived a normal life.
    ------:-----Htilro.-.wVlfabhOlrurrtt-allJ1mniiinnmisltt<>err"'s-Ufe in those days?-----------------------
    Visit sick people, that is part oftheir ministers in the homes or in the hospital and he had to
    attend a lot of different meetings with other ministers and they had to go out oftown and the
    conference meetings and things like that. Dad was not interested in sports or anything but he
    loved to fish so any time that he could get up to Boulder Lake or Fish Lake or sometime I
    remember being with him a couple oftimes and he was very patient and we just sat all day in
    the boat.
    I remember going on part ofhis vacation with him once because he went up to Eagles' Nest
    Lake and he had fixed the car the back seat - the back part ofthe seat so they would go down
    and you could sleep in the car and I remember being up there with him for several days with
    him and I don't remember how old 1 was but I remember-
    He loved to fish.
    I remember also one time he fished at Islaud Lake and the blinding snow storm on the first
    fishing day ofthe season May 15 so here we are in January thinking ofwhat we might have
    to look forward to.

    How would you describe a typical week for a miuister?
    Church, church. Oh well yes and his daughters and son spent all of our time here. We used to
    have three services on Sunday: a Swedish, and English, and a Swedish at night and we three
    kids so caIled we all had to take our turns at being the organist -we alI had training - we all
    had lessons of course piano and organ so brother first because he was older and then I went
    on to nurses' training and my sister, Ruth. So we alI had to spend lots oftime here and lots of
    time then we would have prayer meetings on Wednesday we had to be here. Friday was choir
    practice because then we had to take care ofthe choir and then the three services on Sunday.
    Ofcourse Saturday was confirmation and for whatever. We had willing workers and I
    remember we had it in that second room especially when it was real cold and Dad would put
    fire in that little stove so we huddled around that.
    Is this the organ?
    That's the organ -that's the one we played.
    So you were the center of attention?
    Well, we didn't have a choice; put it that way.
    Any stories?
    I can't remember but like I say it's a little different now with pastors' families. Kids speak up
    more than - I belong to Pilgrim Lutheran church in Superior and I have been there ever since
    ---------I've-bllen-marrilld-m1d-so-I've-been-going-as-member~nd_I-knew-the-family-life-is-a-little-bitt-----­different
    than they were when Naomi and my brother and I grew up here. But that was the
    times; everything has changed. And one thing I have to say that I am proud to say that I was
    brought up in the minister's home. I am very happy that that time-
    Even ifthey were so strict. Mother wasn't but Dad ofcourse -he ruled the roost, I can tell
    you.
    Was he a strict miuister?
    WeIl, it wasn't fire and brimstone, I don't think. He had some good sermons. You know-
    Was the church a place where somebody was coming from Sweden - did they come to
    the church in those early days?
    We did have quite a few people that came over from Finland and find our church. I think it
    was mostly the men who came and some ofthem went back and some didn't go back to
    Finland.

    Oftenwe had visitors to cometo the church; guess wherethey stayed overnight. We would be
    routedout ofour cribs or bedsto take care ofsome other ministerthat is comingto visit. But
    it didn't hurt us.
    Did you get late night phone calls of death in someone's family?
    I don't recall muchofthat. Dadhad a studyand -
    Onething about himthat - he quite oftenhe was up in the middle ofthe night andthen he
    would go downto the kitchenand cookand drinkhis coffeeand study and write sermonsand
    of coursehe did write somebookstoo but that is whenhe did his thinking becausehe said it
    was always more quiet in the houseduringthe nightthan it was duringthe day whenwe were
    around. Quiet, quietdownthere.
    Was he a prolific writer?
    Yes he was. Hehad outlinesbecauseI think I have somestill at home- someoutlinesand ­he
    wouldpreach fromthem.
    He wrote a book?
    Yes I happenedto - I haven't had time to - I have all these and I have to get this all together
    - the Finland Swedes in America; this is it. It waspublished in 1931 and it is all here
    translatedto the English languagebut howI received these was through the Swede-Finn
    Historical Societyand there referredto the Finland Swedes had a lodge and they are still
    active out west- Bruneberg Lodgeandthe Bruneberg Lodgeof Seattle is then there - they
    had publications calledthe LeadingStaror in Swedish? but - so the editor of that paper,
    ---------I\}oug Hansen,we were in touch or contactandhe said that we WIll seethat youget the
    publication and this is of course I wouldtake it out likethis and so there is 26 chapters. It was
    a big book;just by lookingat all of this you can see what our fatherwas doingin the middle
    ofthe night besidewriting for sermons andthis wasn't the only book.
    Did he ever tell you why?
    Oh,he was so proud ofhis peopleand he felt it andthen of coursehe traveledto get some
    . information for the book.He went out west andthere are quitea few Finland Swedes in that
    area, and California and out in Michigan and Mass. Andalso Australia; there are a lot of
    Finns and Swedes. Sothis is what I say; he reallydid quitea bit of-
    He knew of the other people who were working the church; is that where he got the
    information?
    Ipresume he got that throughmanypeopleand I think towardthe end here the several people
    that menthat were influenced him andthat is wherehe got informationfrom.
    He wrote that in Swedish?

    Yes, in Swedish.
    Was he in the lodge?
    We - I think we were members for a while. W.e weren't lodge people; we never had been.
    There wasn't any reason to. It was a sick benefit.
    Was there a chapter here in Duluth?
    They had many years ago but they had it - there were two up on the range also.
    What other books did he write?
    I have sent a couple ofours out there. Well we know "Safe Channels" aud then "My
    Home... " and I don't remember the translation ofthe rest of it. I don't have the list with me
    that I sent to the Historical Society.
    Did he perform a lot of weddings?
    I imagine he did at one time; it was a very busy church and congregation. And so he it was a
    lot ofactivity in this church.
    How many members?
    200 or so. Maybe when they were at the peak time might have been.
    Was this church built when he arrived?
    Yes, it was. Yes, because there were other ministers here before Dad came. Pastor Oberg was
    here. Kastlin? was here at that time.
    You said there were 200 or 300 people and you had church services and choir practices;
    were there other social things and choir practices?
    We had dinners and church suppers - oh yes, and we eveb had lutefisk suppers and trout
    suppers - must say something right at this popoibnt, too,that dad organized a church out in
    french river - a church oput there - he felt the need - beind Dad was so interested infishing
    and all he fel the need along the shore out there and then found out they were Finland­Swedes
    and that there was quite a number ofthem - maybe, it was kind ofa mission church
    at the time out there so he did organizethat too. They built after a while but the fi5rst so­called
    services were held in the homes - and then after that they did buid a church up on the
    Ryan road and that was there until they decided - I'm trying to thiuk ofthe date - 51 or 2­52
    and then they had ground-breaking for the new church onRyan road that's there now - so
    it's an active church.

    Another pastor?
    No, he was the pastor there for several years, taking over that so he had this church and then
    French River. In between when he must have ahd a little time - back ill the '30's - he was a
    pastor up in Eveleth, at that church, so he spent some ofhis time - I say a third ofhis time­see,
    he had three churches - and so he was busy.
    Eveleth in the '30's-
    Well, I know because I used to accompany him. I used to play that organ there - kind of a
    reed organ- they had somebody blowing it or pumping it from behind or whatever - so - 1­that
    was a long trek.
    Can you imagine some of the dinners-Iutefisk?
    Oh, that was important part of- in those days - and as I say, lake trout - you see the
    connection we had was French river - then - I remember going up with dad one morning and
    waiting for the - Mr. Sundstrom - Mr.Gunderson- they write out -having pulled up their nets
    and fish and so forth -really fresh fish- I remember getting it and putting it on the back seat
    and offwe went to betherl- fresh - so we had lake trout suppers. That was very good. Of
    course I do like lutefisk, so that was - still do! You could have it everyday and twice on
    Sundays.
    What about special times like holidays - Christmas, Easter - were those a lot of
    A lot ofactivity in the church - you know, Sunday school program here, and we all had to
    take part in that and - special church events - Christmas morning you'd always have morning
    services at 6 o'clock in the morning.! it was called - surprising how many people came out
    for that ~ frost on the windows ---candles next to the windows, you know - it was very very
    ,
    Did you open presents before or after?
    Don't say presents - present - we were lucky then. That was a special service - course we
    had Easter service also. Good Friday - Good Friday services we had in combiuation with
    other churches - we had Elim, .. and other churches. Isn't that funny, I can't remember too
    much on that. Don't know. Can't remember ..
    Confirmation and •••••
    And then after coufirmation the group that we called our Junior league or Luther League ­pretty
    active
    How would you describe the Luther league •••?
    Have a program and - I don't know ifwe had speakers or anything like that but -I don't
    recall. It was an active - very active time.

    Where you had officers and had a meeting?
    We might have ha d a president -
    Dances or parties?
    Oh, heavens, are you kidding? You must be. We weren't even allowed to go dancing or to a
    'movie -or- times have changed. It was strict.
    It must have been difficult for you going to the public school and
    1 always think back going to prom night -I think it was at the Spaulding - we got dressed up
    - and nobody asked me to dance because the kids all knew 1was the minister's daughter, so 1
    was there for a wallflower.
    Well, you were lucky - I don't think anybody ever asked me to go.
    Well, 1 mean 1went - a bunch of- you know- As 1 say 1 didn't get to dance.
    He was pastor here for a long- a relatively long-
    26 years.
    Did - from the time you came to the time - did that change quite a bit?
    Til the time he retired?
    Were churchpeople more liberal and the Sewdish services?
    Oh, no, he cut out the Swedish services - Well, 1don't recall too much. You see, 1went in
    nurses' training in 193 and 1 don't know - 1came back here to Duluth in 37 - but well, yes, 1
    s'pose 1came back to live at home because 1startedto work - 1 don't remember - isn't it sad
    - I'm getting aged it's hard to remember - you were home, too
    Special memories ofthe Depression years in Duluth?
    They certainly weren't very good but everybody was in the same predicament. Cause, things
    weren't as costly as they are now so we managed. 1think from what 1 remember - was his
    salary $125 a month - he when he passed away in 1953 - from '46 on, when he retired, his
    pension was $35 a month.
    Who was - when you say he had a boss he reported to?

    They were called bishops - or it'd be like the head of the synod - Augustana Synod - and I
    think it was probably - they had branches - the ministers from this area maybe had to report
    to someone down in the cities But they main synod was in Rock Island, I think - the
    Augustana, so - oh, yeh
    There was a hierarchy?
    Oh, yes, oh, sure they had to. They had all these obligations and things when the church - the
    main church now what it is called is Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
    Urn, women's role in the church - how would you describe that?
    Very active I would say.
    Ladies' aid society?
    Very active, um-hmm, Dorcas society, they were the mainstay ofthe church, you know, in
    those days, very active. I think in most churches they are still the mainstay. The groups and
    the things that they do. It was a very active church. Good choir, and there's a picture on the
    wall now. Alberta directed the choir. It's so little. He was quite a musician.
    And you said some ofthe services were in Swedish?
    Most people could understand Swedish. I could understand Swedish quite a bit. 1did way
    back. Come to church and hear Dad preach in Swedish, I couldn't quite get it all. At home, if
    he and my mother wanted to talk about something and they didn't want us to know what they
    were talking about, they'd speak Swedish and we knew what the were talkin about. We
    cou trans ate that. It was a little bit different.
    Speak in Swedish?
    I suppose most ofthem. He did a lot ofperiodicals too for the church. And then he wrote for
    the? But... periodicals for the church itselfand so
    Any other humorous stories?
    How many people are going to listen? Statute of limitation run out?
    We can delete some of it. Other things that might shed some light on
    Oh, other thing he did for a hobby, he built boats. Like rowboats. I don't know. He had
    special- Weide, and long at the bow Garage and our basement. I don't know how many he
    had built. How many years - maybe you don't recall the Knudsen Shipyard - ofcourse, it
    was in Superior- and in fact I know the granddaughter of the Knudsens, and anyway he came
    one time to look at my dad's boat and he complimented him on it, he said it was a very well

    done. So that's what he did as a hobby, in his spare time. After writing and preaching and all
    these other things. A winder man.
    Parades and carpentry and wood-working••• Character, do with your families •••
    I know one thing that I do all these years I always any place that I go, I always go about half
    an hour before I have to be there because I don't want to be late because I remember dad
    saying I'd rather be anyplace a half hour early that a haifa minute late. And I carry that
    tradition. I think people have - I'm a believer in being early. That carried over here with me
    too ofcourse.
    Strong work ethic, I s'pose?
    Well, not _ I can't say that.
    Your father and n!'w your brother •••
    Well, I've stayed single and been in the nursing profession most ofmy life except for 20
    years now I've been retired from it. I kept pretty busy. I spent most ofmy nursing time at the
    Duluth Clinic. 39 years - surgery section - surgeons, orthopedics, and for 10 years
    supervisor ofnurses and aides, and so that was very interesting work.
    You told earlier •••
    1988.
    Story behind that.
    Well, we have this organization or so-called - Finland Swedes; they get together - Margaret
    Orley started this many years ago- might be over 10 now - she passed away last year - and
    she said something about - she asked at one ofthe luncheons ifany ofus would be interested
    in taking a trip tpo Finland, so I was interested. Because 1didn't know of any relatives at that
    time - maybe this was a good time to look up somebody ifwe get up to the Verkas area so
    she organized this tour and I think there were 22 ofus but we weren't all from Duluth. That
    went ofthis trip - we spent - 2 liz days in Verkas, that's all but while the planning was going
    on had been over in Finland and found a Harry Silfversten that lived in Memphis, and we
    corresponded and so then there was a reason and I was invited to stay with them which I did
    and so we got to see the church where Dad grew up - it was built in 1453 - a beautiful church
    and he had been back in 1927 and preached there so I was - I took some pictures ofthe pulpit
    because it was up pretty high and those churches they are and then take in a couple of
    cemeteries and found some more Sifverstens - only they were below ground at that point, and
    it was a funny feeling to be way over in Finland and then you see these tombstones - the
    fellow named - same as ours - of. Course it was correct - in past years trying to find more
    Silfversten's -this Harry Silfversten - did start a genealogy- ofSilfversten - and I was able
    to fill in a few things about our family and then I have - its in booklet form, cheaper than this,
    and find out there are several Silfverstens in this country bot they've changed their name to

    Silverstone so - you can't - at this point in my life. I'm too old now to go through some more
    history - I've done enough. But why - it all comes at this time in my life - these things - and
    yet a ways back, we wouldn't have been interested- we weren't. Now how important is-
    When you're reading these stories of your father's translated, are you making
    discoveries ••
    I have to admit that I haven't looked through them yet.. I shouldn't say I have no time, but I
    have to start one of these days and start fromthe beginning, but just from what I have read,
    some portions -I'm amazed at what he did, in writing. I can't believe this was all published in
    1931- my goodness. And all the facts, my goodness, he really delved into this history of the
    Finland-Swedes here in America. I was kind of hoping Mr. Fortnerwas here; I was goingto
    ask him how to ? about - I'd like to have this edited but not for anybody's information,just
    for my sister and me becausethis can be destroyed- it's worth something I meanto me, I
    guess.
    Bethany home?
    The children's home. Its called North Woods - Bethany crises center it is on 40th
    avenue west just right above the railroad tracks. It was on 40th I remember and not the
    - the big building'was on 40th but the other one was down on the avenue because I
    remember going over there sometimes. It was a big house - on the comer from the
    supermarket. That was the first then they built and went across the railroad tracks and
    that big building is still there - it is called Northwoods Crises Center.
    Did your dad have any connection?
    I suppose I think he went there and may have had a speaker and spoke one time or
    other but it was a place for orphans and I don't know ifthey had any programs. Ijust
    remember going there once but I can't remember what ifwe had a bunch of church
    here to go or - that is a long, long time ago.
    By the way this coming year 1988 or 1989 its going to be 100 years old - this is 1998
    I know but it would be a 100 years old or 99 years old - because I asked Mr. ? that
    last year because he mentioned about removing the corner stone when the church was
    100 years old and so forth so I think. either this year or -
    What year did your father retire?
    1946.
    He turned it over to another pastor?

    Oh yes and from then there were several pastors. Two or three. Matson was the last
    and who was the other one? Falk after dad.
    I don't remember when the church - Mr. Fortner. had this church for about 10 years
    and it was empty for a while before Mr. F bought it.
    Did you dad continue to write after he retired?
    Oh yes he continued to write, fishing, fishing.
    He painted several altar paintings for various churches. He painted French River
    Lutheran and there is one now that is Holy Cross and that's a big one that is in the
    Fireside room. There is one in Fellowship Hall in French River. I understand that
    there are others in Concordia when we belonged to that little white church. He
    painted that alter painting and I think somebody mentioned the Arnold Church which
    is now the Family ofGod church there should be something there. I haven't pursued
    'all ofthese leads. We do know that he was wonderful artist. And music and whatever
    he was - practically everything. A farmer. And a newspaper - he wrote and was
    editor ofthe Mound Sun Newspaper. He composed music, opera. Now this is our
    brother not our father.
    Anything else?
    He used to love children and in our home there on Central Avenue, his study of
    course was offthe living room and the windows on the study face the porch because
    that was years ago when they all had process and the little kids in the neighborhood
