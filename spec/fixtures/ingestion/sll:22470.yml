  Glenn E. Kelley: GEK
  Steve Young: SY
  [Track 1]
  0:00
  SY: Good afternoon, Mr. Justice.
  GEK: Good afternoon, Steve.
  SY: I understand your father was born in a covered wagon. Was your grandfather moving out West or something?
  GEK: My grandfather was a contractor that built railroads for the Union Pacific Railroad Company and they were running lines through Idaho and the crews, generally speaking, lived in covered wagons as the track moved westward from Nebraska, Omaha, being the headquarters of Union Pacific to join up with other crews moving from the Pacific Coast to someplace in the Idaho area. That’s why my father was born in a covered wagon out in Boise, Idaho.
  SY: But, as I understand it, you grew up Nebraska. Did your dad homestead at some point?
  GEK: No. My grandfather came back to Nebraska after the railroad was built and he did some farming in the central Nebraska area and he died shortly after my father was born. My father was only two or three years old. My grandmother raised all those 2
  children.
  SY: What do you remember about your grandfather or your father from the pioneer period? Did it have much of an impact on you?
  GEK: No, I never knew my grandfather, of course. My father hardly knew him. He was only two or three years old when my grandfather died. My grandmother lived until she was ninety-six, though. And she had a lot of stories to tell about the Indians—she’d bake pies and set them in the window to cool in those days and the Indians would come along and take them. The Indians would break into trains and go riding off across the prairie with the bolts of calico streaming behind them. My father wrote a book on her life once, but he was a college professor and he had it in his office at the college and the office building that he was in burned down and that manuscript was destroyed. It sort of broke my father’s heart and he never started the manuscript over again.
  SY: Having a father as a college professor might have given you different ambitions. Did it? Did you want to be a college professor?
  GEK: No, not really. My father was a school administrator when I was growing up. He was the superintendent of schools when I was born in the little town of St. Edward, Nebraska. My mother had been a school teacher and when I was a couple years old—I don’t know exactly how old—they moved out to the Panhandle of Nebraska, in western Nebraska where my father was the superintendent and later was the superintendent in northeastern Nebraska in Madison. During those years, he was the superintendent of schools and the school administrator. He was going to the University of Nebraska working on his master’s and PhD degrees in English literature. In 1936, he got his PhD degree and thereafter he became a college professor, teaching English literature.
  SY: What did he think of a son who became a lawyer?
  GEK: Well, that was all right with him. He encouraged me in various fields. My mother, however, had an innate suspicion of lawyers and she wasn’t quite that 3
  enthusiastic.
  SY: Has your experience led you to confirm or deny your mother’s suspicions?
  5:00
  GEK: My grandfather and grandmother—her parents—were immigrants from Sweden. My grandfather was a very successful farmer and had been very successful speculating on the grain exchange in Chicago, for an immigrant. But they used the old country ways and he conducted all the business. For literally months and months at a time, my grandmother would never go to town. She would make out a list and Grandpa would buy the needles and the thread and the goods and so forth and she stayed home on the farm and worked. Well, when he died, he had a considerable amount of property—farms and so forth. My grandmother could hardly speak English. I had difficulty communicating with her as a boy. The banker and a lawyer in the town of St. Paul, Nebraska, that were administering the estate in the 1920s convinced her she should mortgage some of those farms and get into the stock market as the stock market craze was going on in the ‘20s. The result was, with the bust in 1929, a good deal of that property was lost. That’s the reason for my mother’s distrust of bankers and lawyers.
  SY: Did that have any impact on you when you were either litigating or when you were a trial judge? Your mother’s distrust, your grandmother’s bad experience with professionals, so-called?
  GEK: I don’t think so. I think that was something that happened in the times. I don’t think it had any bearing whatsoever.
  SY: What can you remember of your elementary school?
  GEK: Well, before I started school, my parents moved out to western Nebraska to the town of Bridgeport, which is on the North Platte River in the Panhandle of Nebraska, right on the edge of what they call the Sand Hills of Nebraska prairie. As, I boy, I can remember that there were still people at that time living in sod huts out there. The Oregon Trail went right along the North Platte River and through the area of Bridgeport 4
  and I can remember as a boy going with my father when he played golf and the ruts of the Oregon Trail were still there. Just outside of Bridgeport was a rock formation called Courthouse and Jail Rock. It stood up from the prairie and the larger rock was the courthouse and the small one was a jail as they were built in the early days as the people moved westward. And up the road a ways was the town of Scotts Bluff, which was named after a rock formation there, which is the largest town in Western Nebraska. I went to elementary school there. My father was superintendent and I have some good memories of that. I received from one of my former classmates at Christmastime a little clipping out of the Bridgeport newspaper reporting that sixty years ago, a friend of ours by the name of Freddy Childs had an eighth birthday party and who was at the eighth birthday party and I was one of them.
  SY: Did any of your teachers give you a particular set of ambitions or an ambition in those elementary school years?
  GEK: I don’t recall that so much. We left Bridgeport in about 1932 or thereabouts, maybe a little bit earlier, to go to Madison, Nebraska. At that time, I was getting into the later grades—sixth, seventh, eighth grades. That’s when you started studying American history and things like that. We didn’t have television in those days, of course, and my parents both encouraged reading and I always liked to read and had good use of the public libraries, which we had in those communities.
  SY: I know in older forms of education in America, there was a great emphasis put on role models—people like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Webster. Many of them were lawyers. Did your love of the law or a sense of what you wanted to do go back to those years or reading about those men?
  GEK: Yes, it did. When you start reading about American history and the formation of our United States government and the Constitution, most of the framers of the Constitution were lawyers. Men like Luther Martin of Maryland, James Madison and James Monroe of Virginia. Patrick Henry was not a great fan of the Constitution, or at 5
  least he was not in favor of the Constitution but he was certainly had a lot to do with the Revolution and what followed. Alexander Hamilton had a great deal to do with the structure of our government today. John Hay and many others. Their biographies were very interesting and got me interested in the law.
  SY: In high school, does anything come to mind? Special classes or particular friends or teachers?
  GEK: I really don’t think so. I pretty much formed my ideas that I would like to be a lawyer when I was in junior high school and so I directed my high school efforts toward that end. You don’t have too many electives in high school but I liked history courses, debate courses and things of that nature, which were kind of directed towards my ultimate goal of someday becoming a lawyer.
  10:00
  SY: Did the Depression hit Nebraska pretty hard?
  GEK: Yes, it did. Very hard. We had the Dustbowl, of course. I remember the dust blowing so hard that they would send the children home from school in pairs so they wouldn’t get lost. It would be black as night out.
  SY: Like a winter blizzard, I suppose.
  GEK: Like a winter blizzard in the day. Our desk at school would just be covered with dust that came through the windows of the old buildings. They were not as tight as modern buildings. It was very miserable. Well, that preceded the Depression. As I say, my father was the superintendent of schools and I remember in one year he took a fifty percent cut in salary and the next year he took another fifty percent cut. There were a lot of people much worse off than we were. That was typical. There were no unions for teachers or anything like that in those days. 6
  SY: Did the economic setback that your father and those around him had to put up with—did that ever shake your faith in the country or our economic life or the way we do things?
  GEK: No, it never did. Everybody was in the same boat in those days. It was just a matter of degree. In Nebraska, nobody was awfully wealthy and most of the so-called poor people were taken care of one way or another and people helped each other and struggled along. It was kind of exciting, looking at it in retrospect. I’m not sure I’d want to go through it again. But it was kind of an exciting period in how people did work together and so forth. As a young boy, as a newspaper carrier, I remember how hard it was for some of my customers just to come up with the twenty-five cents a week or whatever the newspaper cost in those days.
  SY: What was the role of religion in your life at that point or in those days? Did people turn to religion during the Depression out of fatalism to get through the hard times or did they ignore it?
  GEK: As a young child, religion played a much greater role in the community than it does today. Almost everyone that I knew belonged to some church or another and they were active in it. Sunday was a lot more of a sacred day than it is today, which is more or less commercialized. That was a time when they had the Sunday laws and all that sort of thing and they were observed. Towns closed down and that was church.
  SY: Was there any particular preacher or religious point of view that made an impact on you as a young boy, young man?
  GEK: I can’t say so. No. Not really. My family always insisted we go to church. They happened to be Presbyterian, but for several years I went to a Methodist Sunday School. The Methodist minister was what you’d called a spellbinder orator type and I took some speech lessons from him and I got to like him. 7
  SY: So, as a lawyer, you could learn something from the Methodist preacher.
  GEK: Right.
  SY: Kelley, I understand, would be an Irish name. How does a good Irish family end up being Presbyterian?
  GEK: Well, Kelley is also a Scotch-Irish name and the Presbyterian church is the result of the Church of Scotland, originally from John Calvin across the ocean, across the narrow seas as they call, it to Scotland. I really don’t know the antecedents of my Kelley family beyond my great-grandfather. All I do know is that they emanated from that Plattsburgh, New York area in the Lake Champlain area of New York and where they came from in Europe and when I don’t know.
  SY: Would the fact that your family was Presbyterian have an influence on the fact that you have been a Republican most of your life when you were in partisan politics?
  GEK: I don’t think so. My father was a very active Democrat.
  SY: Well, what happened there? [Laughs]
  15:00
  GEK: We didn’t talk politics much at home.
  SY: I also understand that in 1936, you worked for Alf Landon.1
  GEK: That’s correct.
  SY: And your dad was for FDR [Franklin D. Roosevelt]. Those would have been some good--
  GEK: I’m not sure he was for FDR. My father was a very strong prohibitionist. One of the first things FDR did, if you will recall, was to go for the repeal of the Eighteenth
  1 Governor of Kansas from 1933-1937 8
  Amendment, and my father was never a real fan of FDR. He always called himself a Wilsonian Democrat.
  SY: What attracted you to the Republican party and to the Landon campaign?
  GEK: Well, at the time, I was in high school and one of my friends had found some music in the dump. It happened to be music for a German band and so we formed a German band of our own and used that music and the Landon people were having a big rally in Madison and somebody asked us if we’d play for the Landon people with the sunflower and all that business and that’s what got me in to the Landon campaign. So we were asked to play for several rallies. We’d warm up the crowd with some German oompah music.
  SY: What did you play?
  GEK: Clarinet.
  SY: You played the clarinet. Was that usual for a farm kid in Nebraska to pick up the clarinet?
  GEK: Oh, yeah. They had bands, high school bands and stuff. Our band had clarinet and bass horn and saxophone.
  SY: I guess at that point, jazz was coming in. It was the Jazz Age in the ‘20s.
  GEK: We weren’t good enough to play jazz. We had to read music! [Laughs]
  SY: Did you have jazz records and did you listen to the radio?
  GEK: No. We had popular music, of course, but the Chicago or Dixieland type jazz wasn’t that popular in the early ‘30s. 9
  SY: But I understand you’ve kept your love of music ever since.
  GEK: Yes, the kind of music has changed. That old time oompah music, it doesn’t send me very much. [Laughs] But I do like traditional Dixieland, Chicagoland type jazz and paradoxically, I also have an interest in classical music, particularly opera.
  SY: This is jumping ahead of the story a little bit, but I’d like to ask for some reflections on any similarities you sense between the way music works and the law and being a judge. Are these two totally different parts of your life or do somehow they reinforce each other?
  GEK: I don’t think they are different parts of the life. Music is relaxation but it is orderly, too. Even jazz is orderly, within limits. But I think any human endeavor has a bearing upon the law because the law deals with all human endeavors. If you have an interest in art or music or whatever, it has some bearing, sometime on the law. But I don’t see any really immediate thing that attracted me either way.
  SY: When you graduated from high school, you’d already decided you wanted to be a lawyer. Did that influence your choice about going to college?
  GEK: No, it really didn’t, but the Depression was still on when I graduated from high school, at least in the Midwest it was, and my father was a college professor and we lived a block from the college and so it was pretty much pre-ordained where I was going to college. And that’s where I went.
  SY: Did they have one of those tuition waiver systems for the children of college professors?
  GEK: No. But the tuition was really pretty high. It was $22 a quarter.
  SY: Of course, in the Depression—it’s hard for us today to imagine that a lot of people couldn’t even afford $22. 10
  GEK: That’s correct. I had a college friend who played on the football team and he lived from Sunday night until Friday night on nothing but pancakes. As part of his college tuition, he served as a volunteer fireman in the college fire department. He slept in a dormitory they had for these volunteer firefighters. All he had to eat was pancakes from one weekend to the next. It was tough getting an education in those days.
  20:00
  SY: When did you graduate from college, vis-a-vis the start of World War II?
  GEK: When I went into World War II, I was just a few hours short of having enough for my B.S. degree. Due to some work I took in getting commissioned in the Army Air Force, the school credited me some of that Army work to give me those hours and so, actually, I was graduated from college while I was in the Army.
  SY: What year did you join the Army Air Force?
  GEK: 1942.
  SY: So it was not too long after Pearl Harbor.
  GEK: That’s right.
  [Track 2]
  0:00
  SY: After the Depression, a great event in our country’s history was World War II. What do you remember about the feelings of yourself, your family, your friends, about entry into World War II and Hitler, and the Japanese, Roosevelt?
  GEK: Well, you will recall, up until Pearl Harbor, the country was very much divided about whether we should get in to World War II. President Roosevelt and his advisors were taking steps that were designed in the minds of a good many people to antagonize Hitler and draw us into the conflict on behalf of England. There was a considerable debate in the country at the time about that. And there were some strong feelings. I was living and going to college in Aberdeen, South Dakota, at that time. I think I can say that 11
  the majority of feeling in the Midwest, at least, was somewhat isolationist—that we should stay out. And they felt Roosevelt was going too far and 4 trying to provoke us into the war. But when Pearl Harbor came, why, all those arguments evaporated. We were in it. But even then, I think that for a good while, the people—at least in the area where I lived—directed their resentment and animosity towards the Japanese more than they did the Germans. Whether that was due to the fact that there were a lot of people of German ancestry in the Midwest, I don’t know. But nonetheless, it was true, I think, where I lived. It wasn’t true all over the country.
  SY: Do you remember what the position of the Republican party was? Where were you in the political spectrum at that time?
  GEK: Well, the candidate in 1940 was Wendell Willkie, as you may recall. He took a position, as I recall, that was contrary to the President. He thought the President was going too far. Of course, that was early times. In 1940, the conflict in Europe had just started a short time before. Subsequently, he repudiated that position, but that was the feeling and Wendell Willkie was popular in the Midwest—in Nebraska and South Dakota, at least those are the areas I knew about.
  SY: What was your position then, on the New Deal as a social experiment? Or was that something that people didn’t talk about too much in your part of the country?
  GEK: We did, and probably I was more aware of it than most students my age because I was a History major and Social Science minor and I was very heavily involved in debate. We debated such issues as the Social Security Act and things of that nature and so we had to do a lot of reading and studying about it.
  SY: Were you forming a political philosophy for yourself at that time? 12
  GEK: Yes, I think I was. It’s one that I’ve kind of hung on to over the years, and that is that sometimes government’s the problem and not the solution. Just throwing money on a program doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be better.
  SY: What persuaded you in that direction? The facts? Your religious background? Your common sense?
  5:00
  GEK: I don’t know. It was just my feeling and my reading. You’ve got to remember that there was just an incredible amount of waste and stuff with these programs in the Roosevelt Era. And there is something morally repugnant to people in the Midwest about taking milk out and dumping it along the side of the road and killing pigs off and burying them, and so forth.
  SY: Why would the government want to do that?
  GEK: To create demand for agricultural products by reducing the supply. That was part of their Agricultural Act under Henry Wallace back in the ‘30s. That was the kind of things that I saw growing up in the Midwest and that was the kind of thing you heard about. You heard the farmers talking about it and the people who were trying to help had very much mixed emotions about it, about the morality of doing that.
  SY: Presumably, the farmers would benefit, though. If you reduce supply, the price would go up. So wouldn’t they like it?
  GEK: That’s what I was saying. There was a lot of diversity. People had different thoughts about it. Some of my relatives were farm people and had different thoughts about it. Some were very strong and saying we have to do it. And others just had some reservations about the morality of destroying food when people were starving and so forth. 13
  SY: When you were debating in high school and college, did you become one of those self-righteous debaters always convinced that there is a clear and simple answer and that you had it?
  GEK: No, no. In those days, you might in the morning be debating one side of the issue and in the afternoon the other side.
  SY: The way you were talking about the Agricultural Adjustment Act, I got a sense that you saw it as a real dilemma, a real choice, that there are no easy answers. Is that generally your point of view?
  GEK: That’s true. I think that’s true of a lot of our major issues in the world today. They are not black-and-white answers.
  SY: Now, is this Justice Kelley reflecting back, having gained wisdom with maturity, or did you actually see it in those shades of grey as a young person.
  GEK: I think I saw it and I’ll tell you why, Steve. It’s because we had to in debate. As I say, we’d be debating in the morning on one side of an issue and in the afternoon on the other side of an issue, just as a lawyer tries a lawsuit on one side of an issue today and the next week, he may be representing a client where he has to advocate the other position. That’s how you see the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments either way.
  SY: Isn’t that just kind of immoral? I mean, you never take a stand on anything?
  GEK: Well, you can take a stand on something, but you don’t have to become a zealot if there are reasonable arguments on the other side. You don’t have to go whole hog on the thing and say, ‘well this is a better solution than that.’ And that’s a philosophy I developed when young, that there isn’t a right way and a wrong way to these things. There’s some good and bad and we’ve got to make some choices. 14
  SY: It seems to me that leaves you open for being influenced and persuaded by a wide variety of people. You’re going to be ready to listen to anybody, it seems to me.
  GEK: Isn’t that what it’s all about?
  SY: Well, is it?
  GEK: I think so.
  SY: There are just so many wacky people floating around with strange ideas. Why should we listen to them?
  GEK: Well, maybe some of the people with wacky ideas have something thought to be a wacky idea by one generation but isn’t so wacky later on. Take, for example, the Townsend Act back in the early 1930s. Dr. Townsend and his Social Security ideas. What he proposed was considered way far out in those days and what we have in our Social Security system today is certainly far beyond anything he ever advocated and so, you don’t know whether an idea is wacky or not until it’s had a chance to be aired and tested by the experience of time.
  SY: Mr. Justice, how do you deal with the problem of your own emotions and feelings when you hear a different idea or a strange idea? A lot of people react instinctively to block out what other people say or feel. Isn’t the human tendency not to listen to other people?
  GEK: I think you’re right. I think it is.
  SY: What happened to you? If you believe in this way of living, how can people get to an open-minded situation? 15
  10:00
  GEK: Well, I think that there is a natural resistance to an idea that is contrary to a position that you had established in your own mind. I agree with that. But some of the things that I was pretty certain were correct a few years ago, I’m not so certain are correct today and that’s been true as you go through life, with me at least.
  SY: If I could ask the question again for your reflection, what can people do with themselves or to themselves to be more open-minded? Is there anything you did? Any little mental games or character building or something? Or was it just the experience of debate?
  GEK: I think it’s probably the experience of debate to realize that there’s more than one side to a question. Even though you might be advocating one, well, there’s something to be said on the other side, too and even though you might conclude one side is the answer, still there are problems on the other side, too. A good example is the Agricultural Adjustment Act of the 1930s. There was some good to trying to decrease the supply so that there would be a demand for the products, but it had a reverse side of the coin, too, that had some drawbacks to it and you have to kind of balance those off.
  SY: I can understand how you, as a lawyer, when you were a trial lawyer, could advocate this side or that side with indifference, almost, to help your client. But as a trial judge and later as an appellate judge, you’re supposed to come up with a right and wrong answer, aren’t you?
  GEK: Well, maybe that’s what you are supposed to do, but Pontius Pilate asked a long time ago ‘what is truth’ and when we’re talking about justice, we’re talking about truth. Truth is in the eye of the beholder and you have to try to do the best you can based upon rules of law and precedent and so forth and so on. There are lots of times you’re not sure that what you’ve done is really the right thing, but you think it is at the time you do and so you do it. 16
  SY: So what I hear from that is a certain amount of courage is necessary to get to a point where you think you’ve gone about as far as you can go and then you have to take a stand.
  GEK: I think that’s right.
  SY: When you think back, what in your background gave you that kind of courage to take a stand when you felt the time had come?
  GEK: I don’t know. I can’t put a finger on it. It’s just part of judging. You have to listen to both sides and you have your precedents and common law precedents or the statutes as the case may be and then you have to make a decision on the facts in the case and try to stay in the mainstream of the law.
  SY: To get back to history a little bit, do you remember where you were when you first heard about the bombing at Pearl Harbor?
  GEK: I certainly do. I was in college and we were rehearsing for a Christmas pageant on December 7, 1941. We promptly terminated the rehearsal and went to a local place where college kids hung out and we were all going to the recruiting office the next morning to sign up. Then the plea came out that said, “Please don’t go to recruiting offices because they are swamped.” And so, we didn’t. They urged us to wait for our call or to go through an orderly system of enlistment.
  SY: Did you have a choice about joining the Army Air Force or were you assigned to that branch of service?
  GEK: No, I volunteered. I hadn’t been drafted yet. I volunteered.
  SY: What appealed to you about—were you a flyer when you went? 17
  GEK: Yes. There are some facets of the service that are more enjoyable than the others and I figured maybe flying is more enjoyable than slogging through the mud.
  SY: Did you take pilot training?
  15:00
  GEK: No, I was actually trained as a bombardier and navigator and then I got to England in the Eighth Air Force and after I was shot down and wounded the first time, they sent me to something new that the British had discovered and were using and that was air-to-ground radar so they could bomb through the clouds and navigate in one hundred percent cloud cover, which is frequently true, particularly in the winter time in Europe. They sent a bunch of us over there to become trained in that area and that’s what I did from then on.
  SY: You were shot down?
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: Do you remember that one pretty well?
  GEK: Yes, I remember.
  SY: What happened?
  GEK: Well, we’d gone on a raid to Hamburg, Germany. Hamburg, Germany, was the Chicago of Germany. That’s where all their railroads came together. Railroads were much more important in those days than they are today. Then we got shot out on a target run.
  SY: You were in a B-17?
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: Bombardier. Sitting in the belly or in the nose. 18
  GEK: Yes, at that time.
  SY: Feeling pretty exposed, I take it.
  GEK: Yes. There was a little piece of Plexiglas between you and the outside. That’s correct. Well, anyway, we got shot out and so we went back across France, which was then occupied--
  SY: Were you shot out by the flak or by airplanes?
  GEK: Flak. And we were staying in clouds and flying in clouds by instrument only but we had to go down beneath the clouds and get a sure navigation point before the left the coast of continental Europe because if you miss England, it’s a heck of a long way to the next land.
  SY: So, you were the navigator, so it was your job to get the plane back.
  GEK: Both of us. Yeah, I’ve done both.
  SY: And were your four engines working?
  GEK: No, no.
  SY: How many engines did you have?
  GEK: Two.
  SY: Only two.
  GEK: Only two of the four were working. But anyway, we had to let down below the clouds in order to get a landfall so we made sure we got to England and not out in the middle of the Atlantic when we ran out of fuel. We, unfortunately, let down right over Dunkirk, which was still occupied by the Germans, and we were only about 1,000 feet and they shot at us with everything—rifles and hand to aircraft and everything else and 19
  they knocked us out of the sky and we ditched in the North Sea about four or five miles from the coastline and we were out there in lifeboats and then they shelled us with artillery.
  SY: Four or five miles from the European coastline.
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: So you’re in these little dinghies and the artillery is coming at you. Must have given rise to the old pucker factor, as they say.
  GEK: Well, there were nine of us wounded.
  SY: Were you wounded at that point?
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: Where and how badly?
  GEK: In the hand. I almost cut off my thumb.
  SY: Was it shrapnel coming through the plane?
  GEK: It was a result of shrapnel coming through the plane, yeah. But at any rate, soon nightfall came and we were out there at night and we saw the light out there and so we shot up some Very [Verey] pistol flares and it--
  SY: What’s a Very pistol?
  GEK: That’s a signal gun that they use and it shoots up colored flares according to a code and it’s a way of identification. The life rafts were equipped with Very pistols. So we shot up some Very pistol flares and it just so happened that was the time that the British were trying to go up north in Holland to capture the Rhine bridges up there and they had a lot of glider people going over there and they were shot down and their air-sea 20
  rescue was working in that area. They were coming back from there and they saw our Very pistol flares and came over and picked us up, which was very fortunate or I wouldn’t be here today. I doubt we would have survived the night. It was in September and the temperature was very cold and hypothermia and all that.
  SY: What does a person bring back mentally, spiritually from that kind of experience?
  GEK: Well, I don’t know, Steve. Of course, you have a lot of gratitude and you’re thankful and you realize you have resources that you didn’t realize you had before and that sort of thing.
  SY: Was that the end of your military experience, then?
  GEK: Oh, no. That was the beginning.
  SY: The beginning! Did it get better?
  GEK: No. After I got out of the hospital, I went on this radar bombardier navigating business and after that I flew leads for the group and for the wing and for the First Air Division as lead bombardier/navigator. We were shot down another time in Berlin and came back.
  SY: If you fly lead, does that expose you more to the German aircraft and the flak?
  20:00
  GEK: No, it’s more responsibility because you are responsible for the whole mission The whole bomber column flies off of you. Maybe a thousand airplanes.
  SY: And these were flying through clouds and working off radar?
  GEK: Right. Air-to-ground radar.
  SY: Are you interested in military history and military tactics?
  GEK: Very much so. 21
  SY: As a result of this experience?
  GEK: Oh, no. I developed that early when I was young. I became interested in history. I’ve always been interested in history and, of course, much of history has to do with battles and the more you read about that and the more you get into it, the more you read about military tactics. I became very much interested in the American Civil War, which was for sociological as well as military purposes. But many of the modern developments of the military had their antecedent in the American Civil War. I became interested in that at that time. I still have an interest in it.
  SY: Do you think our strategic bombing in World War II, which you were involved with, was a successful strategy or tactic, depending on how you determine it?
  GEK: Well, I guess it depends on what you call successful. A lot of bombs scattered around that didn’t do a heck of lot of good and there were a lot of bombs spread around that didn’t do what they were intended to do and did a lot of damage. On the other hand, there was an awful lot of good done by bombing because you can see that we practically shut down the German Air Force and the German Panzer Division from operating through strategic bombing by bombing their synthetic oil plants. After they lost at Caucasus, they had to rely for their oil and fuel [Tape ends].
  [Track 3]
  0:00
  GEK: You had to just fly right into it and hope they didn’t hit you.
  SY: And to be responsible for 1,000 other planes. That would be a heavy responsibility.
  GEK: Well, yeah. That’s what the lead crews did.
  SY: And that’s what you did.
  GEK: Yeah. 22
  SY: Should we ask you about the accuracy of your bombing or is that an unfair question?
  GEK: Well, sometimes you could never really tell because, first of all—we called it Mickey, that was the code name for what we did—Mickey wasn’t as accurate as you going to the target site and doing visual bombing. No question about it. But it was most accurate when you dealt with contrasting materials. For example, a seaport where you have land and then you have water. The radar does not reflect off of water and so then you could be pretty accurate with it. But if you just have land, like going into Berlin or Minneapolis/St. Paul—now this was early radar, you understand. Now, they’ve got it, I guess, so they can read the license plates on the trucks. But you were kind of doing some area bombing, really. Approximating where the marsh and yards would be, and that sort of thing.
  SY: [unclear – refers to number of missions]
  GEK: I don’t know. Fifteen or so.
  SY: Fifteen?
  GEK: Something like that.
  SY: That’s a lot of missions. I thought a tour was like five or six missions.
  GEK: Oh, no. It was thirty-five.
  SY: Thirty-five on a--
  GEK: I never finished my tour because the war ended before.
  SY: You said you were shot down a second time. 23
  GEK: That was Berlin. We went into Berlin and we got shot out on the bomb run and we came back all the way across--
  SY: Was that also the artillery flak up in the sky?
  GEK: Yes. We came back all the way across Germany and crash landed in Belgium which the American and British forces had just gone through a few days before. We crash landed on a former German airbase in Belgium.
  SY: Were you hurt or wounded?
  GEK: No.
  SY: So that was an easy one, then.
  GEK: Well, that depends on your point of view.
  SY: [Laughs]
  GEK: Kind of nervous going back across Germany with one engine.
  SY: If you are the navigator bombardier in the front nose cone of a B-17 and you’re going to crash land, I presume you go sit somewhere else.
  GEK: Yeah. They have a landing procedure where you go back and take a position away from the nose. Yes.
  SY: Have you seen those World War II flying movies like Twelve O’Clock High?
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: Were they fairly accurate? 24
  GEK: Twelve O’Clock High was fairly accurate. That was one of the more accurate ones.
  SY: Did any of your group leaders or squadron leaders get shaky the way the protagonist in that movie did? Sending the guys out the die and they wouldn’t come back.
  GEK: There was a lot of stress there. You’ve got to remember these were all young people. They were younger than the average age of law students today. There were captains and majors that were twenty-one years old.
  SY: So you either learned to carry the responsibility or you cracked, basically.
  GEK: You had to carry it. Sure you did. At a very young age. Our old man, our colonel, was twenty-seven years old. He was responsible for 6,000 men.
  SY: When you came back, you were with a whole generation of young Americans who fought that war. Did you ever have a sense of culture shock with Americans who hadn’t had that kind of responsibility?
  GEK: I don’t think so. I didn’t.
  SY: It was your whole age group. Everybody had done the same thing.
  GEK: My law school class was ninety percent ex-veterans. There were a few that weren’t.
  SY: Before we get to law school, I understand you also survived a mid-air collision.
  GEK: That’s right.
  SY: Was that with a B-17, too?
  GEK: Right. 25
  SY: What happened there?
  5:00
  GEK: Well, when the war in Europe was over, they had a problem about what to do with the Eighth Air Force in England and idle soldiers are not good. They are nothing but trouble and so some general got the wise idea that we would fly a lot of the ground troops—the armorers and the mechanics and so forth, who take care of the planes and all that sort of work that were not actually air crews—fly them over and give them a tour of the Ruhr Valley in Germany and show them exactly what they’ve been doing for the two or three years they’ve been over in England and what their work had contributed to. Coupled with that, he decided that he’d mix up the crews. They’d have bombardiers and navigators flying as co-pilots and pilots flying as navigators and what have you. And then to complicate the matter further, they overloaded the B-17s and put about twenty, twenty-five people in there and so we took off. And finally, to complicate it even worse, they didn’t have any plan about how these various groups—a unit in the Air Force was called a group—how the groups would go there, so they could go any which way. The result was, there was a lot of prop wash over England. Prop wash is turbulence and very hard to fly in, particularly when you are flying in formation.
  Well, it’s a long story, but we were flying in formation and we got in some prop wash from another bomb group that was heading for the same place we were but a different route and one of the planes in our formation went out of control and came down into us and hit our plane. It went down and twenty-two men were killed in that one and three were killed in our plane.
  SY: Did you have to crash land that one?
  GEK: Yes, we did.
  SY: Were you over water? 26
  GEK: We were over England at the time. We were so low we couldn’t parachute. We were just really getting started.
  SY: Did you have a good pilot on that one?
  GEK: Yeah, we did.
  SY: So he knew how to bring it down as best he could.
  GEK: When we hit the ground, the wing fell off.
  SY: After the war, you went back to law school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Why did you choose that school?
  GEK: Well, there were several reasons. One, I had a professor in high school who was not a lawyer, but he was a Michigan graduate and he kept talking up the Michigan Law School to me all the time. He was one of my favorite professors.
  SY: What had he taught?
  GEK: Journalism. And also, I had a band director in high school who was a graduate of the University of Michigan and he was always talking up the University of Michigan. That’s one reason. The second and probably more important reason was that the University of Michigan Law School was on a trimester system at that time and I got discharged in October, too late to get in on most of the law schools for the fall semester or quarter.
  SY: This is 1945?
  GEK: 1945. It was too early to get into the winter semester. So, I had applied to a number of law schools knowing I was going to get discharged early because I had points. You got points and you got discharged according to how many points you had. I had plenty of points. And I had been admitted to the University of Wisconsin Law School 27
  and University of Michigan Law School and the Harvard Law School said I’d probably be admitted if I’d wait until the next semester started which was in February or whenever. That seemed like an awful long time in those days, after you’ve wasted three years in the service. So, Michigan was on the trimester and they started in November and that’s when I went.
  SY: I believe you’d already met your wife by this point, hadn’t you?
  GEK: Yes. We met in high school.
  SY: So, she was from Nebraska, as well.
  GEK: She was from South Dakota.
  SY: I thought she’d gone to school at Wellesley, out East.
  GEK: She did.
  SY: She went out East to school. And you sort of kept in touch since high school?
  GEK: Yeah, we’d kept in touch. I dated her a little bit in high school and then we didn’t hardly speak to each other for four years and just before I went in the Army, she came home from Wellesley for a long winter vacation. They’d shut down the school because of the fuel shortage during the war in ‘42 and we started dating and eventually got married in ‘46.
  SY: What was it like going to law school back from the war, just married. Your classmates were all veterans. What were your expectations?
  GEK: I wasn’t married the first year I was in law school, Steve. I didn’t get married until I got my freshman grades.
  SY: You had to wait to see how you would do? 28
  GEK: Right. [Laughs]
  SY: Sounds like there was a note of caution in there.
  GEK: Well, yeah. I didn’t want to take on the obligations of supporting a wife until I had an occupation and I didn’t know how well I was doing in law school so I refused to get married until I got the freshman grades.
  SY: Did they come out okay?
  GEK: Yeah. That’s about it—okay. They weren’t all that great, but they were okay.
  10:00
  SY: What was the first year of law school like?
  GEK: I think I never worked so hard in my life doing anything as the first year of law school. In those days, they didn’t have law school admission tests and everything. They’d usually admit you if you had an undergraduate degree with respectable grades and they’d wash out about a third of you in your freshman year. That’s the way most law schools operated in those days. And so you had a tremendous competition. We had these people that were serious students that had been through the war. They’d been delayed anywhere from two to five years in their careers. Many of them were married with children. There was serious competition to see whether you were going to get a seat in the sophomore class. We lived on the campus at the University of Michigan. In those days, it was mostly male and a good many of the students were single and they lived there and there was one time when I was a freshman, I didn’t leave the campus for six weeks, weekends or anything else. Just right there, studying.
  SY: Studying all the time?
  GEK: Studied all the time.
  SY: You felt the competitive pressure, too? 29
  GEK: Yes, I did. Very much so. It was very strong. It was tough.
  SY: Did you feel any anxiety about the fact that you’d come from a smaller college in the Midwest as opposed to Big Ten or Ivy League?
  GEK: No. As a matter of fact, I remember one of my classmates was Phi Beta Kappa and was an instructor at Yale University and he busted out of law school and that didn’t bother me because what you’d done before had very little to do with what. They based it on the grades you got. It was all on examination. As I told you when I was talking with you earlier, it took me about a year to find out what they were trying to get at in law school and once I found that out, why, there was no problem. But that first year, I didn’t know.
  SY: What were they trying to get at?
  GEK: I think they were trying to do something that we talked about earlier this afternoon and that is to be able to look at sides of problems and so that there are various solutions to the problem and to take a choice on the solution that you prefer and be able to sustain it with logical arguments. That’s the conclusion I came to. You’re a former dean of a law school. Maybe that isn’t what law school is about, but that’s what I came to and once I discovered that, I seemed to do a heck of a lot better than I did trying to find ‘the’ right answer.
  SY: Was your legal education adequate for your subsequent career? Was this thing that the school was trying to teach you to do the right thing to teach?
  GEK: We had no clinical education.
  SY: What is clinical education, as you understand it?
  GEK: That’s the practical application of interviewing clients or representing them in matters and drafting documents and things of that nature. The practical side of the law 30
  practice. I’ll never forget when I first went to work in a law office, I made the mistake of saying I enjoyed property courses. One reason I liked property courses is because of the historical tie-in with the English common law and the English property law and how it developed from the time of Henry II on. They came in and put an abstract on my desk and asked me to examine it. It’s the first abstract I’d seen in my life. I think it took me two weeks to examine that abstract, but I finally got the job done. But we didn’t have that kind of practical training in law school in those days. It wasn’t available.
  SY: Were you well-educated in law school?
  GEK: I think so. I really felt that the training was excellent even though it was essentially theoretical.
  SY: But as I understood you saying, it was theoretical with a method to its madness. They wanted to make you see that there was no right answer and that you had to come up with an argument. Sounds to me like it was the same thing you’d experienced in high school with debate.
  10:00
  GEK: It was, but I didn’t realize it until about halfway through my freshman year, or maybe longer than that because in those days, you’d go to law school almost a full year before you’d take any examinations because most classes were year-long classes. And they’d give one examination and that was end of the course and so you really had no benchmarks along the way to know how you were doing. I think we did have one or two courses that were semester courses in freshman year but they weren’t the real toughies. But as soon as I realized what they were driving at, no problem.
  SY: What were your teachers like in class? Did they make you stand up and answer hard questions or did they lecture to you?
  GEK: It was the Socratic method of questions and answer and you’d have the class assignment, so many cases for a day and the professor would change the facts a little bit and see how you could cope with that. He’d say, “Well, suppose you’d change the facts 31
  to have this…” and so forth and so on. We didn’t have to stand up and stand at attention or anything like that but you would have to answer.
  SY: What did you feel about your law school professors? Were they going out of their way to be intimidating or did they try to “hide the ball”?
  GEK: I didn’t think they did. I thought that they would challenge us. I remember one professor who would go out of his way when we were studying corporations to antagonize a couple of the more liberal brothers who were very pro-union and so forth. He’d state the facts in such a way that in order for them to answer, they would have to take a position that was anti-union. And it just bothered them to heck to have to do that. He was showing them the other side of the coin by changing the facts a little bit.
  SY: Which sort of made your point again, that there are always many sides to an issue if not a coin. I think you mentioned once that in the Air Force, everything focused in on the right answer. There was only one way to do it and it kind of took you a while to make a shift to this law school way of thinking.
  GEK: That’s right. In the Army, there is one way to do it—the Army’s way. You did it that way or you did it the wrong way and after three years of that, it was a little bit difficult to grasp the law school meaning.
  SY: The Army runs on published rules and regulations. The legal system runs on promulgated law. Shouldn’t our legal system look for right answers so that it’s simple and coherent and people know what they are supposed to do?
  GEK: Well, of course, you know it does in very many instances. If you’ve got a statute that is clear and applies to your particular facts, why, there is no problem. You apply the statute. But so frequently, the facts don’t quite jibe with the wording of the statute, and that’s when you have to start analyzing and comparing and drawing analogies and so forth and so on. 32
  SY: So when people complain that the law is too complex and that there are too many cases, your answer would be that it’s not the law that complex, I suppose, but that life itself is complex.
  GEK: Sure, that’s my belief.
  SY: Shouldn’t the law and lawyers and judges try to simplify life, try to make it easier for people to comprehend?
  GEK: I think they generally do, but as you know, like every snowflake, every case is a little bit different. It’s almost impossible to draft a rule or to draft a piece of legislation and anticipate every possible combination of facts that are going to be governed by that rule or by that piece of legislation. And so you have to extrapolate and interpret in order to arrive at an answer.
  SY: Did you enjoy that intellectual gymnastics in law school?
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: So you never felt you’d made a mistake in choosing law. I think you once said that if you hadn’t been a lawyer, you would have been a military officer. How does that work?
  GEK: I enjoyed the military and I’ve had an interest in military problems as we discussed a little earlier this afternoon for many years. I think that I could have liked to be in the Army.
  SY: Even though the military might be a little more rigid and inflexible than the law has been?
  GEK: Right.
  SY: Of course, you mentioned that you have been fascinated by military history and 33
  the study of battles. One of the greatest theorists of warfare battle, Carl von Clausewitz had this concept of friction. Nothing ever goes according to plan. Do you follow von Clausewitz?
  20:00
  GEK: I think that’s very true. You can give many examples of that in a number of campaigns and a number of battles. It never goes according to plan. The Battle of Gettysburg, for example, would certainly have been won by the Confederates if General Longstreet hadn’t drug his feet until it was too late.
  SY: What lesson do you draw from all this about the kind of people we ought to be? You have a vision that there are lots of choices, things don’t go according to plan, rules and laws can’t solve our problems because they can’t foresee everything. What kind of a person is going to be best in that kind of a world, filled with choices and uncertainties?
  GEK: The type of person that can analyze and make choices which we have to do in our society every day. Even grocery shopping, you have to make those sorts of choices. I very much think that it’s much better than having a system of law, for example, based upon the Continental system of published codes.
  [gap in recording]
  [Track 4]
  0:00
  SY: Mr. Justice, we’re continuing our conversation. It’s been a couple of months since we spoke and I think when we left off the last time, we had got you into law practice in southern Minnesota and then you were appointed to the Trial Court. Was becoming a judge something that you wanted to do? Had you sought out that position?
  GEK: Yes, I had always thought that that was a career I’d like to explore. I’d always had that idea in mind that I’d like to eventually end up as a judge, particularly as a trial judge. 34
  SY: What appealed to you about the position? It doesn’t pay that well.
  GEK: Well, no. But something appealed to me that I was very much interested in and a part of—the adversary system. But you were just that—an adversary—as a lawyer most of the time. To be able to rise above that adversary position and be able to analyze the thing from more or less an unbiased point of view appealed to me. I always thought I would enjoy that. And another thing. After twenty-two years of being chased around by clerks of court and having weekends and holidays spoiled and everything, I thought I’d like to be the one doing the chasing rather than the chase. [Laughs]
  SY: You mention that the adversary system didn’t give you a feeling that you’d come to the truth, let’s say. There are a lot of people who question the role of lawyers in society, saying they’re hired guns, that they’ll take any side. There is kind of a moral disdain for our adversary system. Do you actually sympathize with that criticism?
  GEK: I do not. I agree that it’s there but I do not sympathize with it. I feel that the adversary system really is very good and I have a great deal of admiration for somebody who will take a case that I know that the particular lawyer personally involved does not approve of the position he officially takes or she officially takes in court. Yet that lawyer just does a terrific job for his or her client, saying everything that ethically can be said in support of the client’s position and doing it forcefully and letting the decision-maker, who is the judge or the jury as the case may be, come up with the decision. I had a good example of that in the context of a moot trial after I came up here. [Unclear] personal injury lawyer had tried a medical malpractice case and done a very good job and that was his job. He routinely handled medical malpractice cases. But there was a very serious evidentiary question that came up, which he lost in the trial court. He came up here and we sustained the [unclear]. In the mock trial, he was assigned a position on the other side and he just did a beautiful job on the other side, even though you knew that personally, having read his brief up here, I knew what his real feelings were, but nonetheless, I thought he did a very professional job. His job was to say everything that ethically could 35
  be said in favor of his client and he did so. It was just an excellent example of what I’m talking about.
  5:00
  SY: Which is the position that professionalism requires a distancing of yourself from your own beliefs and feelings, I guess. That you have a job to do and you’ve got to get on top of your own beliefs.
  GEK: That’s correct.
  SY: But a lot of people seem to feel that people can’t do that because that’s asking too much of people.
  GEK: I think that there is that feeling, but I would hope that it could be dispensed with because really, it’s not fair to the lawyer who is doing his job affording the poor and the unpopular with competent legal counsel. It’s not the lawyer’s job to make those moral decisions. It’s the job of the judges and the jurors or the bodies who our society gives that job to. It’s not the lawyers’.
  SY: I suppose, then, when we talk about criminal law that you hold to your position even more forcefully that a criminal—let’s assume someone really is guilty of the crime charged—still should have a lawyer who acts as if the person is innocent, even though that morally bothers a lot of citizens.
  GEK: Well, yes. Too frequently, it’s not a question of guilt or innocence. It’s a question about whether or not the arrival at that conclusion was done according to all the rules of the Constitution and law and protection set up for the freedom and so forth of the citizen. In this case a citizen who has been accused of a crime. In other words, before we send that person to prison for a long period of time, we better make darn sure that we send him there having followed all of our own rules. 36
  SY: So you are saying that the criminal justice system is not so much designed to separate out the guilty from the innocent in advance, but as a check on the government.
  GEK: As a check on the government and to make sure that the government proves the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A good many people may think, “Well, the guy’s guilty as sin,” but the question is, did the government prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. That’s the real question according to the rules of the Bill of Rights of the state and federal constitutions and so forth. I’m afraid a lot of the laypeople don’t appreciate that distinction, but it is a very important distinction.
  SY: I’d like to return to that with some questions for you about the rights that our Constitution gives to people accused of crime, but I’d like to get back to your appointment to the trial bench. Do you remember when you first heard that you were going to be made a judge and what were your feelings at that moment?
  GEK: Yes, I remember. I had mixed feelings. I was a partner in a firm and doing well and we had lived in the same community for twenty-two years and been active in it and it would mean that I’d have to leave that community.
  SY: Where were you working?
  GEK: In Austin.
  SY: And your appointment was where?
  GEK: My appointment was in the Third Judicial District and Austin is in the Third Judicial District but my chambers were going to be in Winona, which is a hundred miles away. And it would require a move to Winona. That’s the best thing that ever happened to me.
  SY: Why? 37
  GEK: Winona is a beautiful, beautiful area and there are a lot of wonderful people there and we enjoyed it there very much. Great place to raise kids.
  SY: Does Winona still have some of the tradition of being a river town?
  GEK: It’s a river town and I’m a river rat.
  SY: How does that make a difference in the culture of the people from Austin, which is more farming country and Hormel processing?
  GEK: Well, they are more laid back. They like jazz music and hiking in the bluffs and rivering it up and they are not quite so staid and organized. I don’t know. It’s hard to describe.
  SY: It’s not the traditional river boat gamblers, is it?
  GEK: Well, there might be a little bit of that, too.
  SY: Do you remember your first case, by any chance?
  GEK: Well, I do happen to remember it, if you’re talking about jury cases, because I had twenty-five of them in a row.
  SY: When you were a new judge, you had to do twenty-five jury trials?
  10:00
  GEK: Twenty-five jury trials. Condemnation cases for Interstate 90, which was going across southern Minnesota, one right after another. Going through Winona and Olmsted Counties.
  SY: So you learned about imminent domain law very quickly.
  GEK: I learned that instruction on the measure of damages and imminent domain so I didn’t even have to look at a piece of paper. 38
  SY: You mentioned instruction. What is that?
  GEK: Well, the instruction is the law that the trial judge gives the jury and the jury is bound to follow the law as given to it by the trial judge. The lawyers propose suggested instructions to the judge and the judge examines the proposals, does his or her own research and comes up with the instructions that he or she is going to give to the jury to guide them in their deliberations. Everybody has input into the process. The state, the defense, sometimes [unclear] and of course, the court. And before it’s given to the jury, the lawyers have an opportunity to make objections and so forth and so on to protect their record. But that is the law that guides the jury in arriving at its decision.
  SY: What flexibility does a trial judge have in giving the instructions?
  GEK: Not too much. If the instruction is proper, he or she should give it.
  SY: Which did you prefer, civil or criminal cases?
  GEK: Well, usually—not always—criminal cases were more, “interesting.” More dramatic. Not always. Sometimes there is a great deal of drama in a civil case. I didn’t have any real preference.
  SY: Did you feel that the legal system we have was adequate? Was it serving the needs of the communities that you knew?
  GEK: When I was a trial judge, a good share of that time we still had an emphasis on the fall concept in the tort area, particularly in automobile accident cases, which was pretty much eliminated in the seventies by no fault type insurance, arbitration and things of that nature. Before that time, the courts were just clogged with automobile accident cases about whether one vehicle reached the crosswalk two tenths of a second before one coming from right angles and that sort of thing and juries were deciding those questions. Now most of those are arbitrated under no fault principles and so forth and in that sense, I think that was good. Also, in the area of domestic relations. We also had fault concepts 39
  in there. I’m not completely convinced that elimination of fault concepts in that area was a good thing.
  SY: You are talking primarily about divorce.
  GEK: Yes. I think that the concept or idea of fault may have or should have some bearing on collateral questions such as visitation rights with children, custody, support obligations and things of that nature. But at the present time, they really don’t because they’ve been eliminated by the legislature.
  SY: When you were a judge in the Third District in Winona, were you withdrawn and isolated from the community around you and from lawyers because you had to make decisions or would people come up to you on the street or come by your home and say, judge, I don’t like the system or I do like the system or can you help me on this, can you help me on that?
  15:00
  GEK: No, I didn’t feel I was isolated. Sometimes some people would call up and want to have advice. They’d say I need a lawyer or I’m getting a divorce or something, give me advice and I’d say I’m sorry, I can’t help you. There’s the yellow pages and the telephone book and you can look at that or you can talk to your other friends or somebody but I can’t do that. Once in a while, somebody’d ask you a legal question about a case that was pending or something and you’d have to politely explain to them why you couldn’t do so. But I didn’t feel that I was isolated from the community. Now, I personally tried not to be too buddy-buddy or cozy with the lawyers. I wasn’t rude to them but I didn’t really go fishing with them every weekend or something like that. I felt that while there was nothing really wrong with it, the appearance that there might be something wrong with it was bad and so I just didn’t do it. Didn’t socialize. I wouldn’t accept invitations to a lawyer’s house unless the entire bar was invited. If a lawyer was inviting the entire bar, which in a small community may be forty or fifty people, that’s
  40
  one thing. But if they were just going to have some members of their firm and the local district judge there, no.
  SY: Why were you so concerned? What would people say?
  GEK: People would say, well, yeah, he ruled against me because he went to Dick Darby’s house for his cocktail party or lawn party or whatever it may be.
  SY: Now, are people really that suspicious?
  GEK: I think they are, yeah.
  SY: What you are describing, then, is the life of a judge which requires self-discipline and control similar to what you just mentioned about lawyers. You’d said a while back that lawyers have to control their feelings and do what’s right for the client. You’re saying a judge has to control his or her feelings and keep a certain amount of distance from some people. What about on the bench? Were there times when your emotions would tug you one way and the law or some duty would tug you another way?
  GEK: I’m sure that that was the case. You knew almost to a moral certainty that the accused was guilty as sin but sometimes the state didn’t have the proof to really nail it down beyond a reasonable doubt and sometimes a rule of evidence would interfere. I remember one time they had a big drug bust and they had twenty-two arrests or something like that and I told the prosecutor, “Choose the case you want to try first.” He chose the so called “kingpin” who was, at the time, considered to be the biggest importer of hard drugs into Minnesota. There was no question that he was guiltier than sin. However, he claimed entrapment.
  SY: That’s a legal doctrine.
  GEK: In other words, he said, “Yeah, I made the sale.” And it was a big sale, like 25,000 units or something involving $100,000 or so. He said, “Yeah, I made the sale, but 41
  20:00
  the government agents, the police, entrapped me into it. They led me into it. I wouldn’t have done it if it hadn’t been for them.” And if the government, in fact, was guilty of entrapment, that is a defense. Well, they wanted to know that name of the government agent who had made the buy, the nark. I knew who it was, the defense attorney knew who it was, the defendant knew who it was, the prosecutor knew who it was, but it wasn’t official on the record. And so, eventually, under the United States Supreme Court decisions, I ruled that the state had to produce the name of the nark. Everybody knew it. The state took the position it would not do so. And so I took the position that either you do so or I’m going to dismiss this indictment. They didn’t do so. I dismissed it. Without the indictment, obviously, the guy got off. He threatened to kill a number of people including me. But there was a situation where your personal thoughts about the guilt or innocence of the individual interfered with what you duty was as a judge in enforcing the law. I thought the law was crazy. When everybody knew that Nick Siminski was the guy that made the buy. Everybody in southern Minnesota knew Nick Siminski. He’d been buying all over. But the defense lawyer in that case was doing what he had a right to do in saying I’ve got a right to know who that was so I can call him because he’s a witness and I have the right to have the witnesses against me be confronted in an open court under the Sixth Amendment. So that’s what I had to do.

  SY: What were the judges like that you practiced before? What had their education been? What did they want from trial attorneys?
  GEK: Actually, I was very fortunate. When I first started out, Martin Nelson was the District Court Trial Judge in Austin and the judicial districts were a lot different then. You also presided in Fillmore and Freeborn County. Martin Nelson later came up here and was on the Supreme Court for a number of years. So he was the first District Judge that I worked under and he was a very good judge on evidence and those sorts of things. In 1952, we put in the so-called Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that streamlined the handling of law suits a great deal. The trial judges generally in southern Minnesota were 42
  outstanding in those days. They were good lawyers and I had good training under those judges all across Minnesota. There were a couple exceptions. There was one in Rochester that was pretty sad, but on the whole, they were very good. Axel Anderson in Owatonna was just outstanding. And the federal judges were good.
  SY: What were you doing in politics during the early fifties? I guess it was forty-eight before you came out.
  GEK: As a matter of fact, I did work on the Dewey campaign. But on a county level, working on some rallies and stuff like that. Later, I became secretary of the county party and then for about eight years was the county chairman down there and also district vice chairman. I just worked for the party generally.
  SY: Southern Minnesota was pretty Republican in those days, I would guess.
  GEK: In those days, it was. Yes. But not Mower County where Austin is. It was a very heavy labor town and very heavy DFL community.
  SY: Was Eisenhower popular where you were?
  GEK: Yes, I’d say he was, yes.
  SY: How did you go about trying to undercut Hubert Humphrey? He was a great man in Minnesota politics but on the other side of the fence.
  GEK: I never really tried to undercut him. I wasn’t that high up in the hierarchy. We would work for the other candidate but we didn’t go out and give speeches or anything like that. We let the politicians do that.
  SY: So you never considered yourself a politician.
  GEK: No. 43
  SY: What is the function of someone like yourself who is very involved in party organization but is not a politician? What rewards do you get from that kind of work?
  GEK: You are working for people that you believe have programs that would benefit the state and you are helping to get the message they have out. You are helping to get the people that support them out to vote for them so they get a chance to do what they want to do. You help to raise the money that is the lifeblood of all political campaigns and those types of tasks. I was urged a number of times to run for public office but I refused.
  SY: Why was that?
  GEK: I’d rather have something to do with who is elected than be the electee.
  SY: Why, though?
  GEK: Oh, it’s a lot of work to run and I just didn’t care to do so.
  SY: But that tradition of famous Americans that you talked about before that influenced you, they were political leaders. Hamilton, Washington, Lincoln, those people.
  GEK: Also, one reason for it, too, Steve, was that ninety percent of my practice was civil litigation. I didn’t want to get too involved in partisan political activity so as to jeopardize my utility to the firm in handling all their civil litigation.
  5:00
  SY: There are people who say that the law and politics are really the same thing and it’s just all a question of who wins the election and who’s got power and that you can’t really use the law against the powerful political leader. Do you agree with that?
  GEK: No, I do not.
  SY: A lot of people believe it. 44
  GEK: An example, at the highest level is the President of the United States—a rather powerful person— who was forced to leave office by the law.
  SY: You are referring to Nixon.
  GEK: Right.
  SY: Did you see just in your career in the fifties in Austin with politics, did you ever see the law of the judges and politics intermingling in an unfair or abusive way?
  GEK: I can’t ever say that I did. We’re very fortunate in Minnesota to have a clean political climate—lots cleaner than lots of other states.
  SY: What accounts for that?
  GEK: I suppose it goes back to our German and Scandinavian people who primarily settled the state, coming here with their moralistic ideals and so forth. I think that tradition is in Minnesota politics. It’s been that way and we like to keep it that way.
  SY: In the mid 1960’s, this country had the civil rights revolution. In the fifties and early sixties, what was your sense of what was going to happen with civil rights, the whole burst of protection of individual rights? Did you see it coming? Did you think we needed it? Was it an issue in Austin?
  GEK: I’ll never forget when I was in the Army in 1944, 1943, down in Monroe, Louisiana, they had one of the most beautiful high schools I’d ever seen up until that time. And about four blocks away, they had an old unpainted building that covered every grade from kindergarten to high school where seventy percent of the population—black-- sent their children to school. The inequality in the type of education that was being afforded on a physical basis was just egregious. And with World War II, where the mostly southern black soldiers came back and you sensed that something was going to happen and had to happen and should have happened and has happened. 45
  SY: The famous case of Brown versus Board of Education, 1954-55. Did that have much of an impact on the law and politics in Minnesota?
  GEK: In the area that I was in at that time, I can say no, it had none, because I doubt that in those days, outside the Twin Cities area, there probably weren’t a hundred black people in Minnesota. Maybe a few in Duluth, but there were none down in the area where I lived.
  SY: Where there any minority people of any kind?
  GEK: Yes. They had Mexican laborers come in to a nearby community called Hollingdale. Hollingdale consisted of some drained lakes and they do a lot of vegetable farming down there. A lot of these itinerant Mexican workers came down and worked the vegetable crop. There were minorities there. And there were also Indians in certain pockets of southern Minnesota.
  SY: Did you ever have an Indian or immigrant worker as a client or have to sue them?
  GEK: Yes. When I was a trial judge in the extreme southeastern corner of Minnesota, we’d get Indians sometimes in the court.
  SY: Any particular litigants, either your clients or on the other side, come to mind as being particularly colorful or the source of a good story or two?
  10:00
  GEK: No, I can’t think of any at the moment. I’m sure there were some but I can’t think of any.
  SY: As a civil trial lawyer, did you form any judgments about whether the system that you were a part of was a good system or not?
  GEK: Well, of course I felt it was a good system. I thought then, perhaps more so than I think today, that the way the civil law system was administered in Minnesota was superior to administrative type hearings, arbitration, mediation and things of that nature. 46
  I might have somewhat different viewpoints on that today in certain areas, but I still think in the area of tort litigation it’s preferable to something along the line of workers’ compensation, for example. More likely to reach the ephemeral target, justice, than you do on a rigid code of rules such as the workers’ compensation law.
  SY: Do you see the principal difference in the presentation of evidence or the funding mechanism?
  GEK: Well, there is a lot to be said for the common law rules of evidence. In too many of these administrative type hearings, they kind of toss the common law rules of evidence out and hearsay and everything else is admitted and given weight. I think there’s a lot to be said for cross examination and all those things. Generally speaking, I felt, with exceptions, that juries did a remarkable job of arriving at a substantially correct conclusion.
  SY: Even when you ended up on the losing side?
  GEK: Even when I was on the losing side. What is the losing side? If I couldn’t settle a case for $50,000 and the jury brought in a verdict against me for $25,000 I was happy as heck. So, you have to ask, what is the losing side?
  SY: This gets back again to your sense that truth is hard to find.
  GEK: Right.
  SY: Why, then, does the workers’ comp system appeal to you?
  GEK: Just for that reason. For example, it’s typical in workers’ comp cases that the attending physician or an examining physician doesn’t appear at all. He writes a letter and they admit that in evidence. There’s no cross examination to test the conclusions that he’s arrived at and so forth. The same thing is true with documentation to support lost wages and that sort of thing. Moreover, there is a temptation to—and it’s 47
  15:00
  happened—as I said, twenty years ago, I did a lot of workers’ compensation work. The legislators fool around with our statutes so much that you wouldn’t know that it’s the same compensation law that I dealt with twenty-five years ago, which I knew pretty well. Now they’ve got so many exceptions and sub-sections and cross-sections and so forth, it’s a maze. It’s like trying to get through the Internal Revenue Code just to follow. A little problem comes up that the law doesn’t cover so they enact another little amendment to the statute and by the time they add all those up, you got a code that’s about that thick instead of a relatively simple system that started out thirty, forty, fifty years ago.
  SY: I’m hearing you say that that experience reinforces your sense that it’s hard to come up with laws, rules and regulations to take care of many, many contingencies.
  GEK: Right. I think so. When I first started practicing law, we could have all the rules of court in Minnesota in about a twenty-five page pamphlet. Now, just the book of rules governing the operation of the courts are three inches thick and somebody’s always saying there’s not a rule to cover this and so then they go and have another rules hearing and put another rule in there.
  SY: Why do you think we’ve shifted to look for more and more rules as a solution to problems?
  GEK: I don’t know. But it’s certainly happened. I keep reminding my colleagues that we have too many rules already, but we still keep grinding them out.
  SY: That search for certainty, I suppose. I’m still not clear, Mr. Justice, between the tort trial system versus the workers’ comp administrative system. Do you come down very strongly in favor of one over the other?
  GEK: We’re going back in time now. Back in the fifties, yes, I would then. I’m not so sure today. I’m sure you’re familiar with the writings of Professor Sugarman at the University of California who advocates a system somewhat along the lines of workers’ compensation system that is government sponsored and with government schedules for 48
  injuries as being more efficient, quicker and less costly and less wasteful and so forth. He’s got some good points.
  SY: So even though you’d be concerned about watering down the rules of evidence in that system, on balance, you think that kind of a system might be an improvement.
  GEK: I’m not sure I’m that far yet. In 1986 I wrote part of an ABA article to rebut Professor Sugarman’s thesis and since 1986, I’ve started to waver a little bit in the certainty that I then had. I think the tort system today has been stretched beyond what was contemplated developmentally by the common law when you get in these massive catastrophe type torts, you get into class actions and all that stuff.
  SY: Where there are thousands of plaintiffs or something like that. In your study of history and your reflections, what was the tort system originally designed to accomplish?
  GEK: I think that tort system essentially evolved from the criminal law. The criminal law was in favor of the crown and it evolved to give the victims of wrongdoing some compensation. I think it’s more a matter of individual on individual rather than these things that probably should be governed in the reparation system by a system. I haven’t quite reached that point yet and I haven’t quite thought it all the way through, but Sugarman’s got some good ideas and some good points. They can’t be discounted.
  SY: So what you’re saying as we sit here in January of 1990 is that a tort system with lawyers arguing before a judge bringing in evidence works pretty well one on one. One plaintiff against one defendant.
  GEK: Or even further than that—involving one incident.
  SY: One airplane crash where 300 people are killed. So you have 300 plaintiffs in that case.
  20:00
  GEK: When you get into these toxic torts and so forth where you have thousands of 49
  women buying thousands of products and they don’t even know what kind of product they’ve bought and you get into the market share theories and all that sort of thing, I think they’re stretching the tort system beyond what it was originally designed or meant to be. When they do that, I don’t think it’s as efficient as it is in the type of thing that we were talking about earlier.
  SY: So you’re prepared now to think about a very different kind of system for coming up with the compensation for people who are hurt or injured.
  GEK: I think it’s worth exploring. I’m not saying that’s the answer but it’s worth exploring.
  SY: Thank you, Mr. Justice.

  GEK: I grew up in the Midwest and I wanted to remain the Midwest and at that time, my in-laws were still alive and my wife and I didn’t want to go back to our home town particularly because people would think of us as the kids who sold peanuts in the ball park and so forth and so on, which isn’t too good for a lawyer, or wasn’t in those days. During the Depression days and the Dust Bowl days, when I was traveling around representing colleges in debate and athletics and so forth, why it always seemed like the corn was a little taller and a little greener in southern Minnesota than it was in South Dakota and so I decided I’d like to practice law in rural Illinois, Iowa or Minnesota. That’s how I ended up here.
  SY: Someone told me that when you took the bar exam, you weren’t sure you’d passed so you didn’t interview for a legal job. 50
  GEK: The bar exam in those days was a lot different than it is today. It was an essay type, twenty minutes of questions, three days, eight hours a day of writing essays on various subjects. And it was not a nationwide bar exam like they have today. There was no true-false multiple choice type questions and it was very much different. I had applied for jobs but after I took the bar, I was so uncertain about it that I expanded my search for a job. I had a wife I figured I had to support and so I applied to some insurance companies who, at that time, were hiring young lawyers. Many young lawyers went to work for nothing in those days, Steve, just in order to get an office. They didn’t get these $40,000 salaries like they do today. The top guy on pay that went out of my law school class got $5,000 a year. The top man. And so, I started applying for a job as an insurance adjuster in some of the insurance companies in the Twin Cities. As it turned out, I got an offer for a job which I took in Austin, and even so, I didn’t move all my furnishings down there until after I got the results of the bar exam.
  SY: Again, a note of caution, realizing that many have slipped between the cup and the lip. How did you end up in Austin as opposed to Wabasha or Rochester or Albert Lea?
  GEK: When I was in law school, there was a fellow student of mine was there who, before the war, was a school teacher and he had taught in Austin and Austin had an excellent school system and also when I was going to college, I worked in the grocery trade for all the time I was going to college and actually was assistant manager of a grocery store during part of the time I was going to college and so I was very much familiar with the George A. Hormel company in Austin who were the pioneers in Spam.
  SY: Had you been eating some Spam in World War II?
  GEK: I’d eaten plenty of what they called Spam. It wasn’t Spam but everybody called it that. So I was familiar with the George A. Hormel Company and what a great company it was and how stable the economy of the Austin area was. So when I was looking for a job I looked all over Minnesota-- Duluth and St. Cloud and Owatonna. One 51
  of the places I interviewed at in Owatonna they said, well, there’s a firm down in Austin that was looking for somebody about six months ago so I went down and interviewed that firm.
  SY: Did you have a car at this point? Did you take busses?
  GEK: I had a car.
  SY: Model? Something made right after the war or an old prewar car?
  5:00
  GEK: I had a used 1946 car. This was in forty-eight when I got out.
  SY: Were they still making all the cars black? Or did you have a colored car?
  GEK: I had a black one. They didn’t make them all black but I had a black one. So I went down there and eventually, that’s where I decided to go. I had a choice between there and Algin, Illinois and Algin, Illinois was just too close to Chicago. Now, today, you can’t tell where one starts and one ends.
  SY: How would you get introductions to a law firm in a small town in those days?
  GEK: Well, Steve, one great thing, fortunately, the University of Michigan Law School had an excellent reputation in the Midwest and that was the best way to get an introduction. One way I went into many law firms is to get Martindale Hubbell out and look up--
  SY: What is Martindale Hubbell?
  GEK: Martindale Hubbell is a directory of lawyers and it tells, among other things, where they went to undergraduate and where they went to law school. So if they had a firm member in there that went to the University of Michigan, that was my entrée. 52
  SY: You’d give them a call and say, “Just graduated from your law school and I’d like to come talk to you.”
  GEK: I had a resume with me and some letters of recommendation from faculty and what have you.
  SY: How did you find the lawyers in Minnesota? Were they interested? Were they cold?
  GEK: Yes, it was tough in those days. I told you that a third of the members of my class went out and went to work for law firms for nothing. They got office space and the right to use the telephone and then after they showed that they could do something, they’d start paying them a little bit. A good salary was a couple hundred dollars a month.
  SY: So you ultimately ended up with an introduction to an Austin law firm. Did you like them right off the bat?
  GEK: Yes, I did. They had a diverse practice and it was a small firm, only four or five lawyers, but they tried to specialize to a certain extent and I liked that and I enjoyed it and they treated me well.
  SY: Was there anything in particular that got you the job as opposed to the next young lawyer with a degree and a resume and a lot of hope?
  GEK: Well, one of the senior partners there had gone to the University of Michigan Law School. I suppose that didn’t hurt. Incidentally, he went to the university law school after he had been admitted to the bar in Minnesota. He’d taken the bar after reading the law in a law office and then he went to law school after he’d been admitted.
  SY: It may be apropos, but I understand Frank B. Kellogg, who was a senator and a famous lawyer came from Austin or Rochester or somewhere? 53
  GEK: He didn’t come from Austin.
  SY: Because he read for the bar, too. I don’t think he ever went to law school. It occurs to me that in recent decades, most young people from your background in smaller towns, rural towns, going to law school want to end up in a big city somewhere—New York, Chicago, Paris maybe. They don’t want to go back to a smaller community. Was everybody different in those days or were you different from a lot of people?
  GEK: I think I was different. When I got out of law school, I was offered a job at the legal department of the Michigan Central Railroad, which was a subsidiary of the New York Central System in Detroit. I was offered the job but I had to go in for a final interview with the General Counsel and Vice President in Detroit. It was on the top floor of the Michigan Central Building and on three sides was glass and you’d look out over all that smoke and stuff that was Detroit back in 1948 and I had to wait a while and by the time I got in to see the fellow, I said, “I don’t want to waste your time, sir. I’ve made up my mind. I’m not interested in the job. I don’t want to live here.” He said, “Sit down. I want to talk to you. I came from North Dakota. I wish I’d made that decision thirty-five years ago.” We chatted for quite a while. I didn’t want to live in a large city. I enjoyed the outdoors too much—the hunting and fishing and all that sort of stuff and I didn’t want to be too far away from it.
  SY: Do you remember your first case in Austin?
  GEK: Yes.
  SY: What was it?
  10:00
  GEK: I was appointed to represent a couple who had been going across southern Minnesota writing a lot of checks and they didn’t have all the constitutional safeguards they have now with Rasmussen hearings and Omnibus hearings and all that sort of thing. The judge called me up and says I’ve got a couple of people, it’s this afternoon, I want you to come over and represent them. So I went over there and the woman was 54
  obviously very pregnant. Very pregnant. And so, I thought, well, I might get her off because of her condition until I asked her whose name she signed the checks in. She’d signed the checks and the fellow she was with had passed them-- the father of her child to be. She got mad at him so he signed his name to the checks. Well, that wasn’t so good so then I turned to the fellow and I asked him about his background and I found out he’d been in the navy and that was right after World War II and the judges were sometimes a little sympathetic to the ex-servicemen getting adjusted and so, I thought I had a chance with him until I found out he had a dishonorable discharge for stealing government goods. That was my first case.
  SY: How well did you do?
  GEK: Well, if you judge it by whether or not they were convicted and served time, they did. They were both convicted and served time. As a matter of fact, the woman was taken from the county jail to the hospital to have her baby a couple days later. But they were both in jail.
  SY: A lot of people wonder, not reflecting on our Constitution, why should known criminals have a lawyer? A lot of lawyers get uncomfortable representing somebody that they know has done some heinous act. How did you feel about that?
  GEK: I take the position I think most lawyers take, that under our system a person shouldn’t pay the penalties of the criminal law unless the state can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did the crime and committed the crime and the legislature in enacting the criminal statutes and the courts that interpret them, the Constitution. It is the duty of the defense attorney to see that the state touches all the proper bases and does things according [unclear] so there’s no doubt about it when a person is deprived of liberty or of property that they’ve been afforded all the rights that the law and the Constitution permits. That doesn’t bother me that I personally might feel that the person was “guilty.” 55
  SY: So your role as a lawyer really wasn’t related to the moral quality of those defendants, but it was much more related to the integrity of the political system.
  GEK: I think so. I represented people that I loathed as a person. But I felt that as a human being they had a right to have all the protection the law afforded and it was my job to see they got it.
  SY: Any of those clients you can tell us about without revealing names or anything? Why would you ever loathe a person?
  GEK: Well, they were creeps. Let’s put it that way. They did things like molest children or take advantage of old people or something like that. But I think every lawyer who has done any criminal work has done that. I didn’t do a lot of criminal work, but I did do some.
  SY: What was Austin like in the late forties when you were there and what did your wife think about it and did you have children right away?
  GEK: Well, Austin was a good town and it was a town that hadn’t had any labor problems for many, many years. It was a town of very high home ownership, something over eighty-five percent of the people owned their own homes and they took good care of them since they did own them. It was a clean town. It had an excellent school system, good churches. It was education minded. It had a junior college along before World War II and they are very much education oriented town. It was a very Democratic town. You might be a hog skinner who lived right next door to the company president. There were no sections of town where the executives lived and the workers lived and that sort of thing. It was a very delightful place to live. That was one reason that I went there, because I knew something about it from this friend in law school who had taught school there.
  SY: You’d had some previous contact with Austin. 56
  15:00
  GEK: Yes. At about the same time that I went there, the Hormel Company was hiring a lot of young engineers and accountants and so forth, coming out of school after World War II and so there were a lot of young people about my age who now have gone through the ranks and become executives and are retired and I’m still working but nevertheless, there was a good group of people to socialize with. I enjoyed it very much.
  SY: How did you consult with your wife about moving to Austin? Did she know much about it?
  GEK: She knew nothing about it. A packing house town as they existed in those days smelled. Packing houses smell. And the first night we were in town, one of our firm members invited us to a social affair, a dinner where there was a speaker and when we came out of the church, the wind had changed and we got the packing house smell and she went home and cried all night. Living in that place. She was more of a—as they say in the play Oklahoma, she wanted to go where the cement grows in the big city. But she got to love it and we still consider that home today.
  SY: How many children do you have, Mr. Justice?
  GEK: I have three.
  SY: Were they all born in the early fifties?
  GEK: No. One was born in fifty-five; one in sixty and one in sixty-five. Five years apart.
  SY: How does a young man develop a law practice in Austin in 1950?
  GEK: It’s a lot different than today. Today they have advertising and all that sort of thing and those were all prohibited in those days, as you know. But you work in community activities and church activities and things like that. I taught Sunday School and I was in the Junior Chamber of Commerce and served on school committees and in 57
  the Elks Club and the American Legion and in the Red Cross and because County Chairman of the Red Cross, for example. I got involved some in politics.
  SY: What were then people looking for in a young lawyer? As they saw you doing these things in the community, were they testing your judgment, whether you were a friendly person or they just wanted to see how you would wear?
  GEK: I think probably that was the way lawyers built their practice. They’d go out and they’d do a good job, for example, on a fund drive or if you were, say, chairman of the local Red Cross, you were doing a good job of handling the affairs and they kind of form their opinion of you, whether they want to entrust their legal matters to you or not. That’s the way you built up a practice in those days. Work on church committees and so forth.
  SY: What flexibility did you have over the kind of practice you were building?
  GEK: We had our firm sort of specialized and because one of the senior partners who did all the trial work got rather ill shortly after I came there, all of a sudden, I was thrust into doing a very heavy civil trial load. And that’s the niche I fell into. I really didn’t start out planning to do that. So for twenty-two years I was pretty much a civil trial lawyer, although I did some estate work and some other work, too. Some municipal work, but real estate, the field I really was interested in when I started out, I probably did practically nothing in.
  SY: You couldn’t get back to Henry II.
  GEK: I couldn’t get into season and all those concepts.
  SY: Did you do plaintiffs work or defendants work?
  GEK: I did both, but the bulk was on the defendant’s side. 58
  SY: And who were your clients, primarily?
  GEK: Well, we represented the George A. Hormel Company. We were their in-house counsel at that time and I did most of their—they were mostly self-insured. I did most of their legal work in Minnesota.
  SY: I’m sorry. What does it mean to be self-insured?
  GEK: They don’t buy insurance policies. They have a reserve on their books and they accept the loss.
  SY: So if somebody sues them and wins, they have to pay the money. They just don’t have an insurance company that’ll pay it.

  GEK: No insurance company to indemnify them or to afford them a defense. Also, under the workers’ compensation law, they were self-insured and any case that got into litigation—now they handled a lot of workers’ compensation matters that never got into litigation in house. But any case that got into litigation, I handled for them. And then, as a result of that, I suppose, I did a lot of insurance company defense work. Mostly civil cases in those days and the courts were filled with them. Or automobile accident cases with no fault insurance which came in about the early seventies eliminated a good many of those types of cases.
  SY: So if there was an automobile accident in southern Minnesota, the insurance company which it insured one of the parties might hire you as the local lawyer to defend in that local court. What courts did you practice before?
  GEK: The district courts primarily in Minnesota. District courts were different in those days than they are now. And the United States District Courts. Primarily those two courts.
  SY: And the U.S. District Court would have been up in the Twin Cities, I take it? 59
  GEK: When I first started, the United States District Court set in Mankato and Winona, Fergus Falls, Duluth and someplace else. Now it only sits in St. Paul and Minneapolis and Duluth.

  SY: That experience, with that criminal trial doesn’t sound like it was very enjoyable. The job of being a judge may not be that easy. If that’s true, what kind of a person makes the best judge?
  GEK: Judge Devitt, the United States District Court Judge here in the District of Minnesota who has been a trial judge for many, many years—35 years or more, is, in my opinion, one of the best trial judges that I ever went up against as a lawyer or as a judge and he wrote a book or a monograph about the qualities of a trial judge. He listed a number of things which the judge should do but they pretty much all added up to one word: patience. You have to be patient. You can get awful discouraged with some [unclear] that keeps droning on on a hot afternoon, putting the jury to sleep and the judge to sleep and everything else. You have to be patient, to let each party present his or her evidence, his or her arguments fully and completely. You still can use some discretion in limiting repetition and that sort of thing but you’ve got to make sure that you are not foreclosing that party from presenting everything that legitimately can be presented for consideration by the fact-finder or the decision-maker, which is the judge or the jury. I always tried to keep in mind two things. I have a little sign that I drew once when I was doodling. It’s sitting right over there. See it? “Patience.”
  SY: Just patience.
  GEK: And I drew that and I did it on the bench and when I left court that evening, the bailiff, who was almost 93 or 94 years old but in remarkably good physical health, picked it up and took it home and framed and it and he gave it to me the next Christmas and I’ve kept it either on my bench when I was a trial judge or here on that shelf since I’ve been 60
  up here. I think that’s good to have patience, to listen out the parties and hear their arguments and not to jump to conclusions too early.
  Another motto or phrase that I always kept foremost in my mind is “Not who, but what is right.” And I found that to be helpful that you may have somebody that you have distaste for but that doesn’t mean that he or she shouldn’t win that particular point.
  SY: What is your response to the culture of the sixties and seventies which says, basically, if you think it, it’s okay, if you want to say it, you should say it and if you want to do it, go ahead and do it. In other words, that your life should not be structured by patience and discipline and control and listening to other people, fitting into a system, that you need to sort of “take charge” of your surroundings and impose your own views and feelings whenever you want.
  GEK: I don’t think much of that. That’s not the job of the judge. If he or she wants to do that, run for the legislature.
  SY: Were there any civil trials involving divorces or accidents or contract disputes which were emotionally difficult or contentious for you as a person and how did you handle that?
  5:00
  GEK: Yes. The most difficult ones were in the early seventies with the school consolidations and closings. Now the matter of the rural schools in these small communities were a matter of extreme emotional concern to the residents of the area, the parents of the children who were going to be affected, the taxpayers, not only the children who might go to one school district or the other but the affect upon the school district that they take them from, which has to do with state aids and a whole bunch of other things. Very strong emotions. Lots of letters to the editor and that sort of thing. Probably the type of dispute that could be better resolved on an administrative level than in the district court process, but it was relegated at that time is generally yet today to the court process on a theory somewhat in the nature of [unclear]. Those were very 61
  dramatic. Contrary to most civil cases when you might have seven or eight or ten people in the courtroom, you’d have hundreds in the courtroom when you had one of these school consolidation cases or whether or not they should build a new courthouse or remodel the old one or those types of public but still civil issues.
  SY: What was the issue you had to decide in the school consolidation cases?
  GEK: Whether or not the particular board that was set up—I forget the name of the board at the time—to look into these things and make the recommendation the school board adopted. Whether they had followed due process and allowed everybody to present and whether they’d given full weight to the issues. It was a terrific issue.
  SY: Was it mostly procedural or were you called upon to assess the rightness of the final decision?
  GEK: We were called upon to decide whether or not the decision of the decision-maker was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Now you, as a lawyer, know that that’s a decision that you’re making. It’s your guess against theirs. But if there is any evidence to sustain their decision, the law generally would require the trial judge to sustain it, even though he or she may disagree with you.
  SY: Again, it’s another example of the need for a kind of discipline and control and saying, “I wouldn’t have decided it that way, but they did and it was their job.”
  GEK: For example, in the school case, I decided the case the way that I wouldn’t have decided had I been part of the decision but I had to concede that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the findings made by this interim board that was set up under the law at that time.
  SY: Do you have any thoughts or advice for people as to what you can do in your own life to get that kind of discipline and build the ability to be patient? 62
  GEK: I think that it’s just something that’s acquired by a law student by the time they matriculate in law school through their entire legal career, particularly if they are following the litigation route. They learn to expect that. They expect that from their judges and they expect that if they are going to become a judge, that they are going to have to do that. I think that’s the way it works. I’m not sure.
  SY: So it is a question of experience. It’s not intellectual. It’s not something you get by reading books.
  GEK: I’m not saying that, either. I think that might have a great bearing on it, but I think it’s all of life’s experience, the way the system works. It can’t work if you have impartial, biased people making the decisions, unreviewable by anybody else. We want a system where it’s fair to everybody and I think that’s imbued in the law student and the law schools and through their training and the ethics and so forth. If and when the opportunity comes for one of them to become a judge, they just kind of naturally fall into that.
  SY: Does enjoyment of history help you gain this kind of patience and tolerance?
  10:00
  GEK: Well, it did me. That’s all I can say. I think one can learn an awful lot from history. We have the example of John Marshall, whose picture hangs behind me here in this office. In several instances during his career, he had to make decisions which were against his or his family’s own interest in Northern Virginia but he seemed to be able to do so. On the other hand, we have the example of Chief Justice Taney of the United States Supreme Court who followed John Marshall who admittedly and publicly announced that he was put on the Supreme Court of the United States to protect the institution of slavery and he did so in the Dred Scott Decision, which was a very great, if not the greatest cause of the breakout of fighting in the Civil War. So there are two examples, one of what you should do and one of what you shouldn’t do as a judge.
  SY: What did you think of the lawyers who appeared before your court in Winona? 63
  GEK: On the whole, they were very good. Of course, some of the younger lawyers didn’t have experience. You had to be more patient with them and sometimes call them in and make suggestions to them— Hey, you forgot to prove up damages or you forgot this or that. If you want me to reopen the case, I will to give you an opportunity to do so or something like that. But on the whole, it was a good bar. Hardworking, competent, able and a good bar can make a mediocre judge look good. And maybe that’s what they did.
  SY: I doubt that. Is the stereotype of the country lawyer, the raconteur before the jury, the good old boy kind of approach accurate?
  GEK: I certainly don’t think so in 1990. I think in 1965, it might have been. One of the most successful trial lawyers in southern Minnesota, boy he had a way with those farmer juries. He could talk their language. He could take a sow’s ear and make a silk purse out of it. But I don’t think he’d have that success today.
  SY: Is that because the lawyers have changed or the people of changed who sit on juries?
  GEK: Both, I think. People have become more sophisticated by watching television and that sort of thing. In the sixties in rural Minnesota, there wasn’t very much television until the latter half of the sixties, at least. And that flamboyance doesn’t go across so much anymore. Some of those farm people are pretty sophisticated with their Cadillacs and Lincolns and hundred thousand dollar piece of farm equipment and so forth and they don’t buy this down to earth humor.
  SY: As a judge, what did you do if there was a very bad lawyer working for a client before you and you could tell that the lawyer was hurting the client’s interest?
  GEK: You did whatever you could. I remember one time, I had a criminal case and the lawyer was just horrible. Just horrible. The jury convicted his client, of course. I figured if that case came up to the Supreme Court, here, that there would certainly be 64
  15:00
  reversed for inadequacy of counsel. Well, I didn’t really want to hold out in public for the newspaper to say that he was inadequate, but they had been arrested in Olmsted County for some other burglaries. I thought, well, I’ll send him over there for trial for sentencing. And whatever they sentence him over there, I’ll make my sentence run concurrently. Well, he went over there but they let him out before they sentenced him and he committed some more burglaries. So they sent him back to me for sentencing for the first one. Well, there was only one thing I could do, which was to set aside his conviction in Wabasha County because there was just no way that would get by the Supreme Court. It was such a bad case of representation. It was terrible. I called him in and I called the lawyer in afterwards and apologized for what I had to do. But I said, God, you just sold your guy down the river. You didn’t give him any defense whatsoever. And he had a good defense! That was the other thing. He had a good defense. The victim of his robbery happened to be his girlfriend’s father. And there was some question about whether he had consent to go in the place. So, at any rate, he went out to Albuquerque, New Mexico and became a prosecutor. I’m not sure how successful he was after he went out there but at least he wasn’t around us.
  SY: Since you’ve joined the Supreme Court, you have participated on the work of the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board, which supervises the discipline of lawyers in Minnesota. Are you satisfied that that board is doing all that it can to keep the bar in Minnesota at the highest standards of excellence?
  GEK: I think it’s doing an excellent job. I suppose that you can’t ever say that any board is doing all that it could because you are talking about resources and finances. It should be kept in mind that the lawyers disciplinary system in Minnesota is solely financed by the lawyers. It is not tax financed at all. The lawyers voluntarily pay fees which the Supreme Court allocates to the lawyers board, pays the staff attorneys and the staff people and so what they can do is limited by their finances to a great deal. We have an excellent director at the present time, good personnel operator and they are doing a good job. And the volume has increased tremendously and it’s very sickening to see 65
  young people spend literally hundreds of thousands of dollars getting a legal education and all that time and effort and work and then to throw it aside by some stupid, unethical conduct. It’s really very discouraging. But they are doing a good job. They are doing about the best job they can under the circumstances.
  SY: What are the most common mistakes that lawyers make or complaints that are brought against them?
  GEK: Procrastination is one. That usually is not of sufficient importance to justify disbarment, but it does justify discipline. What really justifies disbarment is if they get their hand in the till. And sole practitioner, young lawyers out of practice seven or eight years or less, are the ones who run into problems of this nature and it’s sad. It really is.
  SY: Do you see much problem with chemical dependency and alcohol or drugs among lawyers?
  GEK: I don’t know what much is, but we see some, yes. And frequently they will come in and say, yeah, I did procrastinate. I did not communicate with my client. I did not communicate with the court. I lied to my client about what I’ve done with the court, and so forth. But that was because I’m suffering from depression, alcoholism, chemical dependency and so forth and I’ve taken steps to address that by going to Hazelden or wherever and yes, we do get quite a bit of that.
  SY: Do you feel that in general, the standards of the bar are the same, higher or lower than when you started out in practice?
  GEK: My own personal opinion is that they are lower. For one thing, when I started out, they didn’t have the professionalism they have today in the sense that it was absolutely forbidden for us to advertise our services in any way. Now you pick up a telephone book in Austin and look at the yellow pages, and half of the lawyers in there are Twin Cities lawyers soliciting business down in southeastern Minnesota. Personal 66
  injury cases and things of that nature. I think that that’s demeaning of the profession. I’m old fashioned in that regard.
  SY: Doesn’t it provide better service to consumers, though?
  GEK: That’s the argument of the consumers group. I’m not so sure that it does. I don’t think that necessarily follows. It may, but I’m not sure it always does.
  [Track 9]

  SY: Mr. Justice, I understand that you once spent about twelve weeks as a trial judge on just one case. It was Miller versus Miller, I think. What made that case take such a long time?
  GEK: Well, it had its genesis in the immigration of a Russian Jew to the United States shortly after World War I. This immigrant brought with him a wife and several young children and engaged in the rag business in southern Minnesota. In those days, most traveling was done by train and he’d send his children out across southern Minnesota by train. In each town, they’d pick up old rags and stuff and bring them back. Old newspapers and that sort of thing. And he’d process them and sell them out of Winona. Well, gradually, they got to processing these rags in those days there was a great deal of industrial machinery that needed what they call “wipe rags.” They’d launder these rags and cut them into certain lengths. Sometimes they’d dye them and then they’d sell them to railroads or people who use large machinery. They’d wipe their hands, they’d wipe the machinery with it and they’d throw their rags away.
  Also, they developed what was called a waste mill. At one time, there were—I could be wrong about this, this is a long time ago—what were called waste mills and there were some thirty-odd waste mills in the country and these waste mills would go to fabric plants, people who made shirts and things of that nature. On the floor would be little cotton fibers about an inch, two inches long and they’d be swept up every night in piles and they’d sack them up and these waste mills would buy these fibers. They’d process 67
  5:00
  them and package them and what they were—the people who work on the railroad engines would grab a handful of these fibers and use them as wiping, too. And waste mills did this. There was such a demand for the product that if they didn’t get enough sweepings off the floors of the fabric plants, they’d make them out of these rags that they picked up across the country.
  At any rate, one son of this Miller family came to the University of Minnesota. They were all brilliant. Incidentally, Steve Goldberg, who was a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, was a grandson of this immigrant. At any rate, one son went to the University and he refused to work in the junk business and the rag business and he went to New York and became a millionaire in the financial markets in New York. One son dropped out of high school and he was a genius and he was always inventing stuff and getting patents and finding very talented people around the country and hiring them and paying them good money to come and work for him and he is still living and Rudy Miller lives up here in Edina. The third one was a very brilliant young man who went to the University of Minnesota and studied engineering. But when Old Man Miller got sick, he had to drop out of Engineering School at about the third year and he went back to Winona and he actually did most of the actual physical running of the Miller Waste Mill.
  Well, World War II came along and lots of things changed. There was still a great deal of demand for this product that the waste mill made. They used it in packing guns in the navy ships. They used packing or wadding.
  SY: Oh, the wadding. Yeah.
  GEK: They formed a half dozen satellite companies, all of which got their raw product from the waste mill and the waste mill made money. I said there were thirty some odd waste mills in the country at the beginning and in the end, two were left. One of them was the Millers’ in Winona. It was the biggest one in the country. So, Oscar, the one who’d gone to New York and made a lot of money, he came back and sued his brother for diversion of corporate opportunities and so we went back and we had to review 68
  patents and we had to review balance statements and contracts and everything going back from World War I up until 1970’s. Roger Brosnihan was one of the lawyers in the case and Mel Siegel. We tried that case and I held that in this particular instance, there was not a diversion of corporate opportunity under certain rules and it came up here and was affirmed.
  SY: Was this a jury trial?
  GEK: No, it was a court trial. One hundred and some findings of fact. Took me six weeks to draw the findings. It was a very interesting case. You could write one of these serial novels about this family and how this immigrant family came here with literally nothing and worked hard and sacrificed and they were a minority religion and language and yet, had done so well. And had been such philanthropists. They’ve given millions of dollars away to hospitals and educational institutions and things of that nature. It’s really a fascinating story.
  SY: Now, when you talk about the legal doctrine of diversion of corporate opportunities, who were you protecting in that case? Who was the law trying to protect?
  GEK: The law wasn’t trying to protect either party. If the insiders were, in fact, diverting corporate opportunities, the other stockholders had a legitimate compliant. On the other hand, if they weren’t, if it was not a corporate opportunity to begin with, then they had no right to come in and hook on and try to benefit from something that they never had a right to to begin with.
  SY: So your decision was to decide between two groups of people involved in a corporation who had a right to the profits?
  GEK: Yes. It involved millions of dollars.
  SY: As I also recall, at about that time, there was a very unusual case that came up before the Supreme Court in which a Special Supreme Court had to be constituted. I 69
  understand you were part of that special temporary Supreme Court. Could you tell us about that strange circumstance?
  10:00
  GEK: Well, the Wilder Corporation was a charitable corporation here in St. Paul and they financed various kinds of medical research and other research. They had an executive director who had hired a doctor Wild, who was an English physician, to come over here, and he was doing research on mammary cancer and he was really kind of a charlatan. But at any rate, he got in a fight with the director, during the course of which, some of the board of directors of the Wilder Corporation got involved. When the Wilder Foundation was founded back in the early days of this century, they provided that one of the trustees would be appointed by a Supreme Court of Minnesota. And the Supreme Court thereafter always did. James C. Otis of this Court was a trustee and indeed, during the course of this dispute between Wild and the executive director of the Wilder Foundation and others, Judge Otis had some conversations with the participants. It was disputed what was said and what it was about, but he had some conversation. Well, anyway, it got into litigation and Judge Otis felt that he should disqualify himself and he did so, after which Malcolm Williams and J. Remington Graham, who represented Dr. Wild, suggested that the entire Supreme Court might well disqualify itself.
  SY: On what grounds did they seek that?
  GEK: Because they worked every day and were associated with Judge Otis and in order for them to make a decision in favor of Dr. Wild, they’d have to call Judge Otis a liar due to the conflict in evidence between the two and the appearance of impropriety and that sort of thing. Anyway, then Chief Justice Sharon decided to constitute a temporary Supreme Court consisting of the then-Chief Judges of the various district courts in the state and I happened to be Chief Judge of the Third Judicial District and that’s why I got on that court. We met a half a dozen times and eventually decided that case. As I recall, it was six to three in favor of the Wilder Corporation and sent it back for retrial. 70
  SY: Was the authority to constitute a temporary Supreme Court given by the state Constitution, the legislature, or inherent in the powers of the Chief Justice?
  GEK: That was one of the issues in the case, because it hadn’t been decided. Now, it’s in the statutes. But then it wasn’t. That was one of the contentions of Dr. Wild—that the Supreme Court had improperly used the state court administrator to change the law, allowing it to appoint a replacement court for this particular case. That was one of the contentions we had to address.
  SY: When did you first learn that you would be appointed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota?
  GEK: I can’t remember the exact date. It was some night in November of 1981. I knew there was a vacancy and I had applied for it. I got a call from the Governor.
  SY: This would have been Governor Quie at this point?
  GEK: Yes. It was a rainy, sleety night and the Governor said he was going to appoint me Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and I was to be at the capital at nine o’clock in the morning for a press conference. I was already in bed. So I jumped out of bed, put some clothes on, threw some in the car and started heading for the Twin Cities and it was icy and I was slipping all over the road. I got as far as Lake City and I decided I would not go any further and so I holed up in the motel there and I got up in the morning and I didn’t have any money to pay for the room. [Laughs]
  SY: Did they take your credit at that point?
  GEK: Well, I was able to assure them that they’d be paid and they let me go on. I stopped and visited with one of my former law clerks in Hastings and was able to get him to get me fifty bucks so I could eat and get home. But at any rate, it was that night in November, 1981. 71
  SY: Sounds like you were pretty excited by the opportunity to serve.
  GEK: I was very much interested. I had been one of the finalists a year before when Justice Amdahl and Justice Simonett were chosen.
  SY: Now, when you say finalist, that indicates that Governor Quie had some sort of a selection process that he went through.
  15:00
  GEK: Yes, he did. He had a commission or board, part of whom he appointed, but part of whom were appointed by the bar and law schools and so forth who made recommendations to him and they made a recommendation of three or five people out of all the candidates and I understand that the year before I had been one of the finalists. But I thought I was getting a little old to get the appointment the second time around. So I was happy about it.
  SY: Did you have anything particular in mind that you wanted to achieve as a Justice, either a court administration or areas of the law you wanted to look at?
  GEK: Not really, no. I had no agenda.
  SY: Was the Court what you expected it to be once you were up here?
  GEK: In most respects, yes. I can’t think of anything important that was otherwise.
  SY: How does the Supreme Court as an appellate court differ from a trial court?
  GEK: Well, for one thing, in the trial court, the trial judge is “it.” What he or she says goes until it’s been reversed by a higher court. Up here, what a judge says doesn’t go very far. It has to get by at least, at that time, five members of the Court and now it’s four members of the Court for it to go. And so it’s more of a collegial process where you debate and try to convince others. One does that as a trial judge but does it with oneself rather than with others. 72
  SY: In the process here on the Supreme Court of trying to convince others, what are your most effective tools? Precedent, emotional arguments, knowing the prejudices of your colleagues, the briefs of the lawyers, anything else that might come to mind?
  GEK: I’m not so sure I could categorize anything as the most important. I think under appropriate circumstances, each of these might have some bearing upon it. This Court has traditionally been rather loathe to reverse precedent, particularly if it’s of rather recent vintage. If it’s within the last ten years or so, they are pretty leery about re-examining a principal that’s been decided recently. Even if there may have been a change of personnel in the Court that the current personnel would, had they been there seven years ago, decided differently.
  SY: Is a different temper required to be a justice of this Court than a trial judge?
  GEK: I’m not so sure it does. You have to be patient in either instance. There are disagreements between the justices, but we are very fortunate on our Court that we debate robustly in the conference room following argument, but when we close the conference door and we leave it, it’s all left in the conference room and that’s not true of a lot of Supreme Courts and a lot of appellate courts.
  SY: Again, that’s a mark of the personal character of the individuals more than the law itself. Do you find it difficult to dissent from your colleagues?
  GEK: Yes, I think one does. At least I do. I have considerable respect for my colleagues and you better be pretty sure of your position that you’re not being obtuse and obstreperous just for obstruction’s sake. I think it’s difficult.
  [Track 10]
  0:00
  SY: When you are asked to write an opinion for the Court or when you dissent and you are writing for yourself, who is your audience and what do you try to do with the text of the opinion? 73
  GEK: It depends on the opinion who your audience is. Since the advent of the Court of Appeals, we have what we call Rule 117, which defines the kinds of cases we accept for discretionary review. We do have some reviews that come here as a matter of right: first degree murder texts, court cases, workers’ compensation cases, election cases and so forth, but most of our civil and criminal cases come here from the Court of Appeals. At this level—the Supreme Court level— we don’t usually write for the parties. We are writing for the bar, the portion of the bar that is practicing criminal law, the law enforcement officials, the police, and so forth. The scope and limits of procedural laws, constitutional provisions and what have you are limiting what government can do with respect to interfering with the freedom of the individual citizens. So our audience there is to the law enforcement area, in particular. For example, in an employment case, there has been attack for the past few years upon the so-called employment at will doctrine when it will ignored and what will be the results of it and so forth. There we are writing to a large area of employers and employees.
  SY: When you write to a diffuse body, such as employers and employees and their lawyers, which is more important— the narrow decision in the opinion on that case or the more general language you use to explain your policies?
  GEK: Well, I don’t like to get into discussing particular cases, but one of the leading cases in Minnesota is one in which I wrote a dissent and it was Lewis against the Equitable Life Assurance Company. That case very expansively increased the rights of an at-will employee against the employer for wrongful discharge. It was not an interstitial change in the law; it was a major change in the law—several major changes in the law. Five years ago, in 1985, that case bounced around here and I wrote a dissent. As a matter of fact, the dissent was finally published. It was not the first dissent I’d written on the case—it was about the fifth dissent. Some of the arguments I’d raised in prior dissents had been incorporated in the original opinion. But my point is this: that case has been a guideline and the basis of an awful lot of employment law ever since. Now, my dissent hasn’t changed much, but it’s always there as demonstrating the other 74
  viewpoint with respect to certain kinds of damages. So, sometimes when you write a dissent, as Cardozo said, you are “speaking to the brooding spirit of the law.”
  5:00
  SY: Hoping that someone will pick up on it. Do you remember any particular kinds of opinions or opinion that was very easy for you to write?
  GEK: I don’t really, as I sit here. I haven’t thought about it.
  SY: Any that were very hard for you for some reason?
  GEK: Yes. The Lewis case was very hard. I was very uncertain and I was one against seven at that time, as I recall. When you are the only one there, you better be pretty careful that you

  Paul, Minnesota\nJanuary 29, 1990\nAugust 16, 1990\nGlenn E. Kelley: GEK\nSteve
  Young: SY\n[Track 1]\n0:00\nSY: Good afternoon, Mr. Justice.\nGEK: Good afternoon,
  Steve.\nSY: I understand your father was born in a covered wagon. Was your grandfather
  moving out West or something?\nGEK: My grandfather was a contractor that built railroads
  for the Union Pacific Railroad Company and they were running lines through Idaho
  and the crews, generally speaking, lived in covered wagons as the track moved westward
  from Nebraska, Omaha, being the headquarters of Union Pacific to join up with other
  crews moving from the Pacific Coast to someplace in the Idaho area. That’s why my
  father was born in a covered wagon out in Boise, Idaho.\nSY: But, as I understand
  it, you grew up Nebraska. Did your dad homestead at some point?\nGEK: No. My grandfather
  came back to Nebraska after the railroad was built and he did some farming in the
  central Nebraska area and he died shortly after my father was born. My father was
  only two or three years old. My grandmother raised all those 2\nchildren.\nSY: What
  do you remember about your grandfather or your father from the pioneer period? Did
  it have much of an impact on you?\nGEK: No, I never knew my grandfather, of course.
  My father hardly knew him. He was only two or three years old when my grandfather
  died. My grandmother lived until she was ninety-six, though. And she had a lot of
  stories to tell about the Indians—she’d bake pies and set them in the window to
  cool in those days and the Indians would come along and take them. The Indians would
  break into trains and go riding off across the prairie with the bolts of calico
  streaming behind them. My father wrote a book on her life once, but he was a college
  professor and he had it in his office at the college and the office building that
  he was in burned down and that manuscript was destroyed. It sort of broke my father’s
  heart and he never started the manuscript over again.\nSY: Having a father as a
  college professor might have given you different ambitions. Did it? Did you want
  to be a college professor?\nGEK: No, not really. My father was a school administrator
  when I was growing up. He was the superintendent of schools when I was born in the
  little town of St. Edward, Nebraska. My mother had been a school teacher and when
  I was a couple years old—I don’t know exactly how old—they moved out to the Panhandle
  of Nebraska, in western Nebraska where my father was the superintendent and later
  was the superintendent in northeastern Nebraska in Madison. During those years,
  he was the superintendent of schools and the school administrator. He was going
  to the University of Nebraska working on his master’s and PhD degrees in English
  literature. In 1936, he got his PhD degree and thereafter he became a college professor,
  teaching English literature.\nSY: What did he think of a son who became a lawyer?\nGEK:
  Well, that was all right with him. He encouraged me in various fields. My mother,
  however, had an innate suspicion of lawyers and she wasn’t quite that 3\nenthusiastic.\nSY:
  Has your experience led you to confirm or deny your mother’s suspicions?\n5:00\nGEK:
  My grandfather and grandmother—her parents—were immigrants from Sweden. My grandfather
  was a very successful farmer and had been very successful speculating on the grain
  exchange in Chicago, for an immigrant. But they used the old country ways and he
  conducted all the business. For literally months and months at a time, my grandmother
  would never go to town. She would make out a list and Grandpa would buy the needles
  and the thread and the goods and so forth and she stayed home on the farm and worked.
  Well, when he died, he had a considerable amount of property—farms and so forth.
  My grandmother could hardly speak English. I had difficulty communicating with her
  as a boy. The banker and a lawyer in the town of St. Paul, Nebraska, that were administering
  the estate in the 1920s convinced her she should mortgage some of those farms and
  get into the stock market as the stock market craze was going on in the ‘20s. The
  result was, with the bust in 1929, a good deal of that property was lost. That’s
  the reason for my mother’s distrust of bankers and lawyers.\nSY: Did that have any
  impact on you when you were either litigating or when you were a trial judge? Your
  mother’s distrust, your grandmother’s bad experience with professionals, so-called?\nGEK:
  I don’t think so. I think that was something that happened in the times. I don’t
  think it had any bearing whatsoever.\nSY: What can you remember of your elementary
  school?\nGEK: Well, before I started school, my parents moved out to western Nebraska
  to the town of Bridgeport, which is on the North Platte River in the Panhandle of
  Nebraska, right on the edge of what they call the Sand Hills of Nebraska prairie.
  As, I boy, I can remember that there were still people at that time living in sod
  huts out there. The Oregon Trail went right along the North Platte River and through
  the area of Bridgeport 4\nand I can remember as a boy going with my father when
  he played golf and the ruts of the Oregon Trail were still there. Just outside of
  Bridgeport was a rock formation called Courthouse and Jail Rock. It stood up from
  the prairie and the larger rock was the courthouse and the small one was a jail
  as they were built in the early days as the people moved westward. And up the road
  a ways was the town of Scotts Bluff, which was named after a rock formation there,
  which is the largest town in Western Nebraska. I went to elementary school there.
  My father was superintendent and I have some good memories of that. I received from
  one of my former classmates at Christmastime a little clipping out of the Bridgeport
  newspaper reporting that sixty years ago, a friend of ours by the name of Freddy
  Childs had an eighth birthday party and who was at the eighth birthday party and
  I was one of them.\nSY: Did any of your teachers give you a particular set of ambitions
  or an ambition in those elementary school years?\nGEK: I don’t recall that so much.
  We left Bridgeport in about 1932 or thereabouts, maybe a little bit earlier, to
  go to Madison, Nebraska. At that time, I was getting into the later grades—sixth,
  seventh, eighth grades. That’s when you started studying American history and things
  like that. We didn’t have television in those days, of course, and my parents both
  encouraged reading and I always liked to read and had good use of the public libraries,
  which we had in those communities.\nSY: I know in older forms of education in America,
  there was a great emphasis put on role models—people like George Washington, Abraham
  Lincoln, Daniel Webster. Many of them were lawyers. Did your love of the law or
  a sense of what you wanted to do go back to those years or reading about those men?\nGEK:
  Yes, it did. When you start reading about American history and the formation of
  our United States government and the Constitution, most of the framers of the Constitution
  were lawyers. Men like Luther Martin of Maryland, James Madison and James Monroe
  of Virginia. Patrick Henry was not a great fan of the Constitution, or at 5\nleast
  he was not in favor of the Constitution but he was certainly had a lot to do with
  the Revolution and what followed. Alexander Hamilton had a great deal to do with
  the structure of our government today. John Hay and many others. Their biographies
  were very interesting and got me interested in the law.\nSY: In high school, does
  anything come to mind? Special classes or particular friends or teachers?\nGEK:
  I really don’t think so. I pretty much formed my ideas that I would like to be a
  lawyer when I was in junior high school and so I directed my high school efforts
  toward that end. You don’t have too many electives in high school but I liked history
  courses, debate courses and things of that nature, which were kind of directed towards
  my ultimate goal of someday becoming a lawyer.\n10:00\nSY: Did the Depression hit
  Nebraska pretty hard?\nGEK: Yes, it did. Very hard. We had the Dustbowl, of course.
  I remember the dust blowing so hard that they would send the children home from
  school in pairs so they wouldn’t get lost. It would be black as night out.\nSY:
  Like a winter blizzard, I suppose.\nGEK: Like a winter blizzard in the day. Our
  desk at school would just be covered with dust that came through the windows of
  the old buildings. They were not as tight as modern buildings. It was very miserable.
  Well, that preceded the Depression. As I say, my father was the superintendent of
  schools and I remember in one year he took a fifty percent cut in salary and the
  next year he took another fifty percent cut. There were a lot of people much worse
  off than we were. That was typical. There were no unions for teachers or anything
  like that in those days. 6\nSY: Did the economic setback that your father and those
  around him had to put up with—did that ever shake your faith in the country or our
  economic life or the way we do things?\nGEK: No, it never did. Everybody was in
  the same boat in those days. It was just a matter of degree. In Nebraska, nobody
  was awfully wealthy and most of the so-called poor people were taken care of one
  way or another and people helped each other and struggled along. It was kind of
  exciting, looking at it in retrospect. I’m not sure I’d want to go through it again.
  But it was kind of an exciting period in how people did work together and so forth.
  As a young boy, as a newspaper carrier, I remember how hard it was for some of my
  customers just to come up with the twenty-five cents a week or whatever the newspaper
  cost in those days.\nSY: What was the role of religion in your life at that point
  or in those days? Did people turn to religion during the Depression out of fatalism
  to get through the hard times or did they ignore it?\nGEK: As a young child, religion
  played a much greater role in the community than it does today. Almost everyone
  that I knew belonged to some church or another and they were active in it. Sunday
  was a lot more of a sacred day than it is today, which is more or less commercialized.
  That was a time when they had the Sunday laws and all that sort of thing and they
  were observed. Towns closed down and that was church.\nSY: Was there any particular
  preacher or religious point of view that made an impact on you as a young boy, young
  man?\nGEK: I can’t say so. No. Not really. My family always insisted we go to church.
  They happened to be Presbyterian, but for several years I went to a Methodist Sunday
  School. The Methodist minister was what you’d called a spellbinder orator type and
  I took some speech lessons from him and I got to like him. 7\nSY: So, as a lawyer,
  you could learn something from the Methodist preacher.\nGEK: Right.\nSY: Kelley,
  I understand, would be an Irish name. How does a good Irish family end up being
  Presbyterian?\nGEK: Well, Kelley is also a Scotch-Irish name and the Presbyterian
  church is the result of the Church of Scotland, originally from John Calvin across
  the ocean, across the narrow seas as they call, it to Scotland. I really don’t know
  the antecedents of my Kelley family beyond my great-grandfather. All I do know is
  that they emanated from that Plattsburgh, New York area in the Lake Champlain area
  of New York and where they came from in Europe and when I don’t know.\nSY: Would
  the fact that your family was Presbyterian have an influence on the fact that you
  have been a Republican most of your life when you were in partisan politics?\nGEK:
  I don’t think so. My father was a very active Democrat.\nSY: Well, what happened
  there? [Laughs]\n15:00\nGEK: We didn’t talk politics much at home.\nSY: I also understand
  that in 1936, you worked for Alf Landon.1\nGEK: That’s correct.\nSY: And your dad
  was for FDR [Franklin D. Roosevelt]. Those would have been some good--\nGEK: I’m
  not sure he was for FDR. My father was a very strong prohibitionist. One of the
  first things FDR did, if you will recall, was to go for the repeal of the Eighteenth\n1
  Governor of Kansas from 1933-1937 8\nAmendment, and my father was never a real fan
  of FDR. He always called himself a Wilsonian Democrat.\nSY: What attracted you to
  the Republican party and to the Landon campaign?\nGEK: Well, at the time, I was
  in high school and one of my friends had found some music in the dump. It happened
  to be music for a German band and so we formed a German band of our own and used
  that music and the Landon people were having a big rally in Madison and somebody
  asked us if we’d play for the Landon people with the sunflower and all that business
  and that’s what got me in to the Landon campaign. So we were asked to play for several
  rallies. We’d warm up the crowd with some German oompah music.\nSY: What did you
  play?\nGEK: Clarinet.\nSY: You played the clarinet. Was that usual for a farm kid
  in Nebraska to pick up the clarinet?\nGEK: Oh, yeah. They had bands, high school
  bands and stuff. Our band had clarinet and bass horn and saxophone.\nSY: I guess
  at that point, jazz was coming in. It was the Jazz Age in the ‘20s.\nGEK: We weren’t
  good enough to play jazz. We had to read music! [Laughs]\nSY: Did you have jazz
  records and did you listen to the radio?\nGEK: No. We had popular music, of course,
  but the Chicago or Dixieland type jazz wasn’t that popular in the early ‘30s. 9\nSY:
  But I understand you’ve kept your love of music ever since.\nGEK: Yes, the kind
  of music has changed. That old time oompah music, it doesn’t send me very much.
  [Laughs] But I do like traditional Dixieland, Chicagoland type jazz and paradoxically,
  I also have an interest in classical music, particularly opera.\nSY: This is jumping
  ahead of the story a little bit, but I’d like to ask for some reflections on any
  similarities you sense between the way music works and the law and being a judge.
  Are these two totally different parts of your life or do somehow they reinforce
  each other?\nGEK: I don’t think they are different parts of the life. Music is relaxation
  but it is orderly, too. Even jazz is orderly, within limits. But I think any human
  endeavor has a bearing upon the law because the law deals with all human endeavors.
  If you have an interest in art or music or whatever, it has some bearing, sometime
  on the law. But I don’t see any really immediate thing that attracted me either
  way.\nSY: When you graduated from high school, you’d already decided you wanted
  to be a lawyer. Did that influence your choice about going to college?\nGEK: No,
  it really didn’t, but the Depression was still on when I graduated from high school,
  at least in the Midwest it was, and my father was a college professor and we lived
  a block from the college and so it was pretty much pre-ordained where I was going
  to college. And that’s where I went.\nSY: Did they have one of those tuition waiver
  systems for the children of college professors?\nGEK: No. But the tuition was really
  pretty high. It was $22 a quarter.\nSY: Of course, in the Depression—it’s hard for
  us today to imagine that a lot of people couldn’t even afford $22. 10\nGEK: That’s
  correct. I had a college friend who played on the football team and he lived from
  Sunday night until Friday night on nothing but pancakes. As part of his college
  tuition, he served as a volunteer fireman in the college fire department. He slept
  in a dormitory they had for these volunteer firefighters. All he had to eat was
  pancakes from one weekend to the next. It was tough getting an education in those
  days.\n20:00\nSY: When did you graduate from college, vis-a-vis the start of World
  War II?\nGEK: When I went into World War II, I was just a few hours short of having
  enough for my B.S. degree. Due to some work I took in getting commissioned in the
  Army Air Force, the school credited me some of that Army work to give me those hours
  and so, actually, I was graduated from college while I was in the Army.\nSY: What
  year did you join the Army Air Force?\nGEK: 1942.\nSY: So it was not too long after
  Pearl Harbor.\nGEK: That’s right.\n[Track 2]\n0:00\nSY: After the Depression, a
  great event in our country’s history was World War II. What do you remember about
  the feelings of yourself, your family, your friends, about entry into World War
  II and Hitler, and the Japanese, Roosevelt?\nGEK: Well, you will recall, up until
  Pearl Harbor, the country was very much divided about whether we should get in to
  World War II. President Roosevelt and his advisors were taking steps that were designed
  in the minds of a good many people to antagonize Hitler and draw us into the conflict
  on behalf of England. There was a considerable debate in the country at the time
  about that. And there were some strong feelings. I was living and going to college
  in Aberdeen, South Dakota, at that time. I think I can say that 11\nthe majority
  of feeling in the Midwest, at least, was somewhat isolationist—that we should stay
  out. And they felt Roosevelt was going too far and 4 trying to provoke us into the
  war. But when Pearl Harbor came, why, all those arguments evaporated. We were in
  it. But even then, I think that for a good while, the people—at least in the area
  where I lived—directed their resentment and animosity towards the Japanese more
  than they did the Germans. Whether that was due to the fact that there were a lot
  of people of German ancestry in the Midwest, I don’t know. But nonetheless, it was
  true, I think, where I lived. It wasn’t true all over the country.\nSY: Do you remember
  what the position of the Republican party was? Where were you in the political spectrum
  at that time?\nGEK: Well, the candidate in 1940 was Wendell Willkie, as you may
  recall. He took a position, as I recall, that was contrary to the President. He
  thought the President was going too far. Of course, that was early times. In 1940,
  the conflict in Europe had just started a short time before. Subsequently, he repudiated
  that position, but that was the feeling and Wendell Willkie was popular in the Midwest—in
  Nebraska and South Dakota, at least those are the areas I knew about.\nSY: What
  was your position then, on the New Deal as a social experiment? Or was that something
  that people didn’t talk about too much in your part of the country?\nGEK: We did,
  and probably I was more aware of it than most students my age because I was a History
  major and Social Science minor and I was very heavily involved in debate. We debated
  such issues as the Social Security Act and things of that nature and so we had to
  do a lot of reading and studying about it.\nSY: Were you forming a political philosophy
  for yourself at that time? 12\nGEK: Yes, I think I was. It’s one that I’ve kind
  of hung on to over the years, and that is that sometimes government’s the problem
  and not the solution. Just throwing money on a program doesn’t necessarily mean
  it’s going to be better.\nSY: What persuaded you in that direction? The facts? Your
  religious background? Your common sense?\n5:00\nGEK: I don’t know. It was just my
  feeling and my reading. You’ve got to remember that there was just an incredible
  amount of waste and stuff with these programs in the Roosevelt Era. And there is
  something morally repugnant to people in the Midwest about taking milk out and dumping
  it along the side of the road and killing pigs off and burying them, and so forth.\nSY:
  Why would the government want to do that?\nGEK: To create demand for agricultural
  products by reducing the supply. That was part of their Agricultural Act under Henry
  Wallace back in the ‘30s. That was the kind of things that I saw growing up in the
  Midwest and that was the kind of thing you heard about. You heard the farmers talking
  about it and the people who were trying to help had very much mixed emotions about
  it, about the morality of doing that.\nSY: Presumably, the farmers would benefit,
  though. If you reduce supply, the price would go up. So wouldn’t they like it?\nGEK:
  That’s what I was saying. There was a lot of diversity. People had different thoughts
  about it. Some of my relatives were farm people and had different thoughts about
  it. Some were very strong and saying we have to do it. And others just had some
  reservations about the morality of destroying food when people were starving and
  so forth. 13\nSY: When you were debating in high school and college, did you become
  one of those self-righteous debaters always convinced that there is a clear and
  simple answer and that you had it?\nGEK: No, no. In those days, you might in the
  morning be debating one side of the issue and in the afternoon the other side.\nSY:
  The way you were talking about the Agricultural Adjustment Act, I got a sense that
  you saw it as a real dilemma, a real choice, that there are no easy answers. Is
  that generally your point of view?\nGEK: That’s true. I think that’s true of a lot
  of our major issues in the world today. They are not black-and-white answers.\nSY:
  Now, is this Justice Kelley reflecting back, having gained wisdom with maturity,
  or did you actually see it in those shades of grey as a young person.\nGEK: I think
  I saw it and I’ll tell you why, Steve. It’s because we had to in debate. As I say,
  we’d be debating in the morning on one side of an issue and in the afternoon on
  the other side of an issue, just as a lawyer tries a lawsuit on one side of an issue
  today and the next week, he may be representing a client where he has to advocate
  the other position. That’s how you see the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments
  either way.\nSY: Isn’t that just kind of immoral? I mean, you never take a stand
  on anything?\nGEK: Well, you can take a stand on something, but you don’t have to
  become a zealot if there are reasonable arguments on the other side. You don’t have
  to go whole hog on the thing and say, ‘well this is a better solution than that.’
  And that’s a philosophy I developed when young, that there isn’t a right way and
  a wrong way to these things. There’s some good and bad and we’ve got to make some
  choices. 14\nSY: It seems to me that leaves you open for being influenced and persuaded
  by a wide variety of people. You’re going to be ready to listen to anybody, it seems
  to me.\nGEK: Isn’t that what it’s all about?\nSY: Well, is it?\nGEK: I think so.\nSY:
  There are just so many wacky people floating around with strange ideas. Why should
  we listen to them?\nGEK: Well, maybe some of the people with wacky ideas have something
  thought to be a wacky idea by one generation but isn’t so wacky later on. Take,
  for example, the Townsend Act back in the early 1930s. Dr. Townsend and his Social
  Security ideas. What he proposed was considered way far out in those days and what
  we have in our Social Security system today is certainly far beyond anything he
  ever advocated and so, you don’t know whether an idea is wacky or not until it’s
  had a chance to be aired and tested by the experience of time.\nSY: Mr. Justice,
  how do you deal with the problem of your own emotions and feelings when you hear
  a different idea or a strange idea? A lot of people react instinctively to block
  out what other people say or feel. Isn’t the human tendency not to listen to other
  people?\nGEK: I think you’re right. I think it is.\nSY: What happened to you? If
  you believe in this way of living, how can people get to an open-minded situation?
  15\n10:00\nGEK: Well, I think that there is a natural resistance to an idea that
  is contrary to a position that you had established in your own mind. I agree with
  that. But some of the things that I was pretty certain were correct a few years
  ago, I’m not so certain are correct today and that’s been true as you go through
  life, with me at least.\nSY: If I could ask the question again for your reflection,
  what can people do with themselves or to themselves to be more open-minded? Is there
  anything you did? Any little mental games or character building or something? Or
  was it just the experience of debate?\nGEK: I think it’s probably the experience
  of debate to realize that there’s more than one side to a question. Even though
  you might be advocating one, well, there’s something to be said on the other side,
  too and even though you might conclude one side is the answer, still there are problems
  on the other side, too. A good example is the Agricultural Adjustment Act of the
  1930s. There was some good to trying to decrease the supply so that there would
  be a demand for the products, but it had a reverse side of the coin, too, that had
  some drawbacks to it and you have to kind of balance those off.\nSY: I can understand
  how you, as a lawyer, when you were a trial lawyer, could advocate this side or
  that side with indifference, almost, to help your client. But as a trial judge and
  later as an appellate judge, you’re supposed to come up with a right and wrong answer,
  aren’t you?\nGEK: Well, maybe that’s what you are supposed to do, but Pontius Pilate
  asked a long time ago ‘what is truth’ and when we’re talking about justice, we’re
  talking about truth. Truth is in the eye of the beholder and you have to try to
  do the best you can based upon rules of law and precedent and so forth and so on.
  There are lots of times you’re not sure that what you’ve done is really the right
  thing, but you think it is at the time you do and so you do it. 16\nSY: So what
  I hear from that is a certain amount of courage is necessary to get to a point where
  you think you’ve gone about as far as you can go and then you have to take a stand.\nGEK:
  I think that’s right.\nSY: When you think back, what in your background gave you
  that kind of courage to take a stand when you felt the time had come?\nGEK: I don’t
  know. I can’t put a finger on it. It’s just part of judging. You have to listen
  to both sides and you have your precedents and common law precedents or the statutes
  as the case may be and then you have to make a decision on the facts in the case
  and try to stay in the mainstream of the law.\nSY: To get back to history a little
  bit, do you remember where you were when you first heard about the bombing at Pearl
  Harbor?\nGEK: I certainly do. I was in college and we were rehearsing for a Christmas
  pageant on December 7, 1941. We promptly terminated the rehearsal and went to a
  local place where college kids hung out and we were all going to the recruiting
  office the next morning to sign up. Then the plea came out that said, “Please don’t
  go to recruiting offices because they are swamped.” And so, we didn’t. They urged
  us to wait for our call or to go through an orderly system of enlistment.\nSY: Did
  you have a choice about joining the Army Air Force or were you assigned to that
  branch of service?\nGEK: No, I volunteered. I hadn’t been drafted yet. I volunteered.\nSY:
  What appealed to you about—were you a flyer when you went? 17\nGEK: Yes. There are
  some facets of the service that are more enjoyable than the others and I figured
  maybe flying is more enjoyable than slogging through the mud.\nSY: Did you take
  pilot training?\n15:00\nGEK: No, I was actually trained as a bombardier and navigator
  and then I got to England in the Eighth Air Force and after I was shot down and
  wounded the first time, they sent me to something new that the British had discovered
  and were using and that was air-to-ground radar so they could bomb through the clouds
  and navigate in one hundred percent cloud cover, which is frequently true, particularly
  in the winter time in Europe. They sent a bunch of us over there to become trained
  in that area and that’s what I did from then on.\nSY: You were shot down?\nGEK:
  Yes.\nSY: Do you remember that one pretty well?\nGEK: Yes, I remember.\nSY: What
  happened?\nGEK: Well, we’d gone on a raid to Hamburg, Germany. Hamburg, Germany,
  was the Chicago of Germany. That’s where all their railroads came together. Railroads
  were much more important in those days than they are today. Then we got shot out
  on a target run.\nSY: You were in a B-17?\nGEK: Yes.\nSY: Bombardier. Sitting in
  the belly or in the nose. 18\nGEK: Yes, at that time.\nSY: Feeling pretty exposed,
  I take it.\nGEK: Yes. There was a little piece of Plexiglas between you and the
  outside. That’s correct. Well, anyway, we got shot out and so we went back across
  France, which was then occupied--\nSY: Were you shot out by the flak or by airplanes?\nGEK:
  Flak. And we were staying in clouds and flying in clouds by instrument only but
  we had to go down beneath the clouds and get a sure navigation point before the
  left the coast of continental Europe because if you miss England, it’s a heck of
  a long way to the next land.\nSY: So, you were the navigator, so it was your job
  to get the plane back.\nGEK: Both of us. Yeah, I’ve done both.\nSY: And were your
  four engines working?\nGEK: No, no.\nSY: How many engines did you have?\nGEK: Two.\nSY:
  Only two.\nGEK: Only two of the four were working. But anyway, we had to let down
  below the clouds in order to get a landfall so we made sure we got to England and
  not out in the middle of the Atlantic when we ran out of fuel. We, unfortunately,
  let down right over Dunkirk, which was still occupied by the Germans, and we were
  only about 1,000 feet and they shot at us with everything—rifles and hand to aircraft
  and everything else and 19\nthey knocked us out of the sky and we ditched in the
  North Sea about four or five miles from the coastline and we were out there in lifeboats
  and then they shelled us with artillery.\nSY: Four or five miles from the European
  coastline.\nGEK: Yes.\nSY: So you’re in these little dinghies and the artillery
  is coming at you. Must have given rise to the old pucker factor, as they say.\nGEK:
  Well, there were nine of us wounded.\nSY: Were you wounded at that point?\nGEK:
  Yes.\nSY: Where and how badly?\nGEK: In the hand. I almost cut off my thumb.\nSY:
  Was it shrapnel coming through the plane?\nGEK: It was a result of shrapnel coming
  through the plane, yeah. But at any rate, soon nightfall came and we were out there
  at night and we saw the light out there and so we shot up some Very [Verey] pistol
  flares and it--\nSY: What’s a Very pistol?\nGEK: That’s a signal gun that they use
  and it shoots up colored flares according to a code and it’s a way of identification.
  The life rafts were equipped with Very pistols. So we shot up some Very pistol flares
  and it just so happened that was the time that the British were trying to go up
  north in Holland to capture the Rhine bridges up there and they had a lot of glider
  people going over there and they were shot down and their air-sea 20\nrescue was
  working in that area. They were coming back from there and they saw our Very pistol
  flares and came over and picked us up, which was very fortunate or I wouldn’t be
  here today. I doubt we would have survived the night. It was in September and the
  temperature was very cold and hypothermia and all that.\nSY: What does a person
  bring back mentally, spiritually from that kind of experience?\nGEK: Well, I don’t
  know, Steve. Of course, you have a lot of gratitude and you’re thankful and you
  realize you have resources that you didn’t realize you had before and that sort
  of thing.\nSY: Was that the end of your military experience, then?\nGEK: Oh, no.
  That was the beginning.\nSY: The beginning! Did it get better?\nGEK: No. After I
  got out of the hospital, I went on this radar bombardier navigating business and
  after that I flew leads for the group and for the wing and for the First Air Division
  as lead bombardier/navigator. We were shot down another time in Berlin and came
  back.\nSY: If you fly lead, does that expose you more to the German aircraft and
  the flak?\n20:00\nGEK: No, it’s more responsibility because you are responsible
  for the whole mission The whole bomber column flies off of you. Maybe a thousand
  airplanes.\nSY: And these were flying through clouds and working off radar?\nGEK:
  Right. Air-to-ground radar.\nSY: Are you interested in military history and military
  tactics?\nGEK: Very much so. 21\nSY: As a result of this experience?\nGEK: Oh, no.
  I developed that early when I was young. I became interested in history. I’ve always
  been interested in history and, of course, much of history has to do with battles
  and the more you read about that and the more you get into it, the more you read
  about military tactics. I became very much interested in the American Civil War,
  which was for sociological as well as military purposes. But many of the modern
  developments of the military had their antecedent in the American Civil War. I became
  interested in that at that time. I still have an interest in it.\nSY: Do you think
  our strategic bombing in World War II, which you were involved with, was a successful
  strategy or tactic, depending on how you determine it?\nGEK: Well, I guess it depends
  on what you call successful. A lot of bombs scattered around that didn’t do a heck
  of lot of good and there were a lot of bombs spread around that didn’t do what they
  were intended to do and did a lot of damage. On the other hand, there was an awful
  lot of good done by bombing because you can see that we practically shut down the
  German Air Force and the German Panzer Division from operating through strategic
  bombing by bombing their synthetic oil plants. After they lost at Caucasus, they
  had to rely for their oil and fuel [Tape ends].\n[Track 3]\n0:00\nGEK: You had to
  just fly right into it and hope they didn’t hit you.\nSY: And to be responsible
  for 1,000 other planes. That would be a heavy responsibility.\nGEK: Well, yeah.
  That’s what the lead crews did.\nSY: And that’s what you did.\nGEK: Yeah. 22\nSY:
  Should we ask you about the accuracy of your bombing or is that an unfair question?\nGEK:
  Well, sometimes you could never really tell because, first of all—we called it Mickey,
  that was the code name for what we did—Mickey wasn’t as accurate as you going to
  the target site and doing visual bombing. No question about it. But it was most
  accurate when you dealt with contrasting materials. For example, a seaport where
  you have land and then you have water. The radar does not reflect off of water and
  so then you could be pretty accurate with it. But if you just have land, like going
  into Berlin or Minneapolis/St. Paul—now this was early radar, you understand. Now,
  they’ve got it, I guess, so they can read the license plates on the trucks. But
  you were kind of doing some area bombing, really. Approximating where the marsh
  and yards would be, and that sort of thing.\nSY: [unclear – refers to number of
  missions]\nGEK: I don’t know. Fifteen or so.\nSY: Fifteen?\nGEK: Something like
  that.\nSY: That’s a lot of missions. I thought a tour was like five or six missions.\nGEK:
  Oh, no. It was thirty-five.\nSY: Thirty-five on a--\nGEK: I never finished my tour
  because the war ended before.\nSY: You said you were shot down a second time. 23\nGEK:
  That was Berlin. We went into Berlin and we got shot out on the bomb run and we
  came back all the way across--\nSY: Was that also the artillery flak up in the sky?\nGEK:
  Yes. We came back all the way across Germany and crash landed in Belgium which the
  American and British forces had just gone through a few days before. We crash landed
  on a former German airbase in Belgium.\nSY: Were you hurt or wounded?\nGEK: No.\nSY:
  So that was an easy one, then.\nGEK: Well, that depends on your point of view.\nSY:
  [Laughs]\nGEK: Kind of nervous going back across Germany with one engine.\nSY: If
  you are the navigator bombardier in the front nose cone of a B-17 and you’re going
  to crash land, I presume you go sit somewhere else.\nGEK: Yeah. They have a landing
  procedure where you go back and take a position away from the nose. Yes.\nSY: Have
  you seen those World War II flying movies like Twelve O’Clock High?\nGEK: Yes.\nSY:
  Were they fairly accurate? 24\nGEK: Twelve O’Clock High was fairly accurate. That
  was one of the more accurate ones.\nSY: Did any of your group leaders or squadron
  leaders get shaky the way the protagonist in that movie did? Sending the guys out
  the die and they wouldn’t come back.\nGEK: There was a lot of stress there. You’ve
  got to remember these were all young people. They were younger than the average
  age of law students today. There were captains and majors that were twenty-one years
  old.\nSY: So you either learned to carry the responsibility or you cracked, basically.\nGEK:
  You had to carry it. Sure you did. At a very young age. Our old man, our colonel,
  was twenty-seven years old. He was responsible for 6,000 men.\nSY: When you came
  back, you were with a whole generation of young Americans who fought that war. Did
  you ever have a sense of culture shock with Americans who hadn’t had that kind of
  responsibility?\nGEK: I don’t think so. I didn’t.\nSY: It was your whole age group.
  Everybody had done the same thing.\nGEK: My law school class was ninety percent
  ex-veterans. There were a few that weren’t.\nSY: Before we get to law school, I
  understand you also survived a mid-air collision.\nGEK: That’s right.\nSY: Was that
  with a B-17, too?\nGEK: Right. 25\nSY: What happened there?\n5:00\nGEK: Well, when
  the war in Europe was over, they had a problem about what to do with the Eighth
  Air Force in England and idle soldiers are not good. They are nothing but trouble
  and so some general got the wise idea that we would fly a lot of the ground troops—the
  armorers and the mechanics and so forth, who take care of the planes and all that
  sort of work that were not actually air crews—fly them over and give them a tour
  of the Ruhr Valley in Germany and show them exactly what they’ve been doing for
  the two or three years they’ve been over in England and what their work had contributed
  to. Coupled with that, he decided that he’d mix up the crews. They’d have bombardiers
  and navigators flying as co-pilots and pilots flying as navigators and what have
  you. And then to complicate the matter further, they overloaded the B-17s and put
  about twenty, twenty-five people in there and so we took off. And finally, to complicate
  it even worse, they didn’t have any plan about how these various groups—a unit in
  the Air Force was called a group—how the groups would go there, so they could go
  any which way. The result was, there was a lot of prop wash over England. Prop wash
  is turbulence and very hard to fly in, particularly when you are flying in formation.\nWell,
  it’s a long story, but we were flying in formation and we got in some prop wash
  from another bomb group that was heading for the same place we were but a different
  route and one of the planes in our formation went out of control and came down into
  us and hit our plane. It went down and twenty-two men were killed in that one and
  three were killed in our plane.\nSY: Did you have to crash land that one?\nGEK:
  Yes, we did.\nSY: Were you over water? 26\nGEK: We were over England at the time.
  We were so low we couldn’t parachute. We were just really getting started.\nSY:
  Did you have a good pilot on that one?\nGEK: Yeah, we did.\nSY: So he knew how to
  bring it down as best he could.\nGEK: When we hit the ground, the wing fell off.\nSY:
  After the war, you went back to law school at the University of Michigan in Ann
  Arbor. Why did you choose that school?\nGEK: Well, there were several reasons. One,
  I had a professor in high school who was not a lawyer, but he was a Michigan graduate
  and he kept talking up the Michigan Law School to me all the time. He was one of
  my favorite professors.\nSY: What had he taught?\nGEK: Journalism. And also, I had
  a band director in high school who was a graduate of the University of Michigan
  and he was always talking up the University of Michigan. That’s one reason. The
  second and probably more important reason was that the University of Michigan Law
  School was on a trimester system at that time and I got discharged in October, too
  late to get in on most of the law schools for the fall semester or quarter.\nSY:
  This is 1945?\nGEK: 1945. It was too early to get into the winter semester. So,
  I had applied to a number of law schools knowing I was going to get discharged early
  because I had points. You got points and you got discharged according to how many
  points you had. I had plenty of points. And I had been admitted to the University
  of Wisconsin Law School 27\nand University of Michigan Law School and the Harvard
  Law School said I’d probably be admitted if I’d wait until the next semester started
  which was in February or whenever. That seemed like an awful long time in those
  days, after you’ve wasted three years in the service. So, Michigan was on the trimester
  and they started in November and that’s when I went.\nSY: I believe you’d already
  met your wife by this point, hadn’t you?\nGEK: Yes. We met in high school.\nSY:
  So, she was from Nebraska, as well.\nGEK: She was from South Dakota.\nSY: I thought
  she’d gone to school at Wellesley, out East.\nGEK: She did.\nSY: She went out East
  to school. And you sort of kept in touch since high school?\nGEK: Yeah, we’d kept
  in touch. I dated her a little bit in high school and then we didn’t hardly speak
  to each other for four years and just before I went in the Army, she came home from
  Wellesley for a long winter vacation. They’d shut down the school because of the
  fuel shortage during the war in ‘42 and we started dating and eventually got married
  in ‘46.\nSY: What was it like going to law school back from the war, just married.
  Your classmates were all veterans. What were your expectations?\nGEK: I wasn’t married
  the first year I was in law school, Steve. I didn’t get married until I got my freshman
  grades.\nSY: You had to wait to see how you would do? 28\nGEK: Right. [Laughs]\nSY:
  Sounds like there was a note of caution in there.\nGEK: Well, yeah. I didn’t want
  to take on the obligations of supporting a wife until I had an occupation and I
  didn’t know how well I was doing in law school so I refused to get married until
  I got the freshman grades.\nSY: Did they come out okay?\nGEK: Yeah. That’s about
  it—okay. They weren’t all that great, but they were okay.\n10:00\nSY: What was the
  first year of law school like?\nGEK: I think I never worked so hard in my life doing
  anything as the first year of law school. In those days, they didn’t have law school
  admission tests and everything. They’d usually admit you if you had an undergraduate
  degree with respectable grades and they’d wash out about a third of you in your
  freshman year. That’s the way most law schools operated in those days. And so you
  had a tremendous competition. We had these people that were serious students that
  had been through the war. They’d been delayed anywhere from two to five years in
  their careers. Many of them were married with children. There was serious competition
  to see whether you were going to get a seat in the sophomore class. We lived on
  the campus at the University of Michigan. In those days, it was mostly male and
  a good many of the students were single and they lived there and there was one time
  when I was a freshman, I didn’t leave the campus for six weeks, weekends or anything
  else. Just right there, studying.\nSY: Studying all the time?\nGEK: Studied all
  the time.\nSY: You felt the competitive pressure, too? 29\nGEK: Yes, I did. Very
  much so. It was very strong. It was tough.\nSY: Did you feel any anxiety about the
  fact that you’d come from a smaller college in the Midwest as opposed to Big Ten
  or Ivy League?\nGEK: No. As a matter of fact, I remember one of my classmates was
  Phi Beta Kappa and was an instructor at Yale University and he busted out of law
  school and that didn’t bother me because what you’d done before had very little
  to do with what. They based it on the grades you got. It was all on examination.
  As I told you when I was talking with you earlier, it took me about a year to find
  out what they were trying to get at in law school and once I found that out, why,
  there was no problem. But that first year, I didn’t know.\nSY: What were they trying
  to get at?\nGEK: I think they were trying to do something that we talked about earlier
  this afternoon and that is to be able to look at sides of problems and so that there
  are various solutions to the problem and to take a choice on the solution that you
  prefer and be able to sustain it with logical arguments. That’s the conclusion I
  came to. You’re a former dean of a law school. Maybe that isn’t what law school
  is about, but that’s what I came to and once I discovered that, I seemed to do a
  heck of a lot better than I did trying to find ‘the’ right answer.\nSY: Was your
  legal education adequate for your subsequent career? Was this thing that the school
  was trying to teach you to do the right thing to teach?\nGEK: We had no clinical
  education.\nSY: What is clinical education, as you understand it?\nGEK: That’s the
  practical application of interviewing clients or representing them in matters and
  drafting documents and things of that nature. The practical side of the law 30\npractice.
  I’ll never forget when I first went to work in a law office, I made the mistake
  of saying I enjoyed property courses. One reason I liked property courses is because
  of the historical tie-in with the English common law and the English property law
  and how it developed from the time of Henry II on. They came in and put an abstract
  on my desk and asked me to examine it. It’s the first abstract I’d seen in my life.
  I think it took me two weeks to examine that abstract, but I finally got the job
  done. But we didn’t have that kind of practical training in law school in those
  days. It wasn’t available.\nSY: Were you well-educated in law school?\nGEK: I think
  so. I really felt that the training was excellent even though it was essentially
  theoretical.\nSY: But as I understood you saying, it was theoretical with a method
  to its madness. They wanted to make you see that there was no right answer and that
  you had to come up with an argument. Sounds to me like it was the same thing you’d
  experienced in high school with debate.\n10:00\nGEK: It was, but I didn’t realize
  it until about halfway through my freshman year, or maybe longer than that because
  in those days, you’d go to law school almost a full year before you’d take any examinations
  because most classes were year-long classes. And they’d give one examination and
  that was end of the course and so you really had no benchmarks along the way to
  know how you were doing. I think we did have one or two courses that were semester
  courses in freshman year but they weren’t the real toughies. But as soon as I realized
  what they were driving at, no problem.\nSY: What were your teachers like in class?
  Did they make you stand up and answer hard questions or did they lecture to you?\nGEK:
  It was the Socratic method of questions and answer and you’d have the class assignment,
  so many cases for a day and the professor would change the facts a little bit and
  see how you could cope with that. He’d say, “Well, suppose you’d change the facts
  31\nto have this…” and so forth and so on. We didn’t have to stand up and stand
  at attention or anything like that but you would have to answer.\nSY: What did you
  feel about your law school professors? Were they going out of their way to be intimidating
  or did they try to “hide the ball”?\nGEK: I didn’t think they did. I thought that
  they would challenge us. I remember one professor who would go out of his way when
  we were studying corporations to antagonize a couple of the more liberal brothers
  who were very pro-union and so forth. He’d state the facts in such a way that in
  order for them to answer, they would have to take a position that was anti-union.
  And it just bothered them to heck to have to do that. He was showing them the other
  side of the coin by changing the facts a little bit.\nSY: Which sort of made your
  point again, that there are always many sides to an issue if not a coin. I think
  you mentioned once that in the Air Force, everything focused in on the right answer.
  There was only one way to do it and it kind of took you a while to make a shift
  to this law school way of thinking.\nGEK: That’s right. In the Army, there is one
  way to do it—the Army’s way. You did it that way or you did it the wrong way and
  after three years of that, it was a little bit difficult to grasp the law school
  meaning.\nSY: The Army runs on published rules and regulations. The legal system
  runs on promulgated law. Shouldn’t our legal system look for right answers so that
  it’s simple and coherent and people know what they are supposed to do?\nGEK: Well,
  of course, you know it does in very many instances. If you’ve got a statute that
  is clear and applies to your particular facts, why, there is no problem. You apply
  the statute. But so frequently, the facts don’t quite jibe with the wording of the
  statute, and that’s when you have to start analyzing and comparing and drawing analogies
  and so forth and so on. 32\nSY: So when people complain that the law is too complex
  and that there are too many cases, your answer would be that it’s not the law that
  complex, I suppose, but that life itself is complex.\nGEK: Sure, that’s my belief.\nSY:
  Shouldn’t the law and lawyers and judges try to simplify life, try to make it easier
  for people to comprehend?\nGEK: I think they generally do, but as you know, like
  every snowflake, every case is a little bit different. It’s almost impossible to
  draft a rule or to draft a piece of legislation and anticipate every possible combination
  of facts that are going to be governed by that rule or by that piece of legislation.
  And so you have to extrapolate and interpret in order to arrive at an answer.\nSY:
  Did you enjoy that intellectual gymnastics in law school?\nGEK: Yes.\nSY: So you
  never felt you’d made a mistake in choosing law. I think you once said that if you
  hadn’t been a lawyer, you would have been a military officer. How does that work?\nGEK:
  I enjoyed the military and I’ve had an interest in military problems as we discussed
  a little earlier this afternoon for many years. I think that I could have liked
  to be in the Army.\nSY: Even though the military might be a little more rigid and
  inflexible than the law has been?\nGEK: Right.\nSY: Of course, you mentioned that
  you have been fascinated by military history and 33\nthe study of battles. One of
  the greatest theorists of warfare battle, Carl von Clausewitz had this concept of
  friction. Nothing ever goes according to plan. Do you follow von Clausewitz?\n20:00\nGEK:
  I think that’s very true. You can give many examples of that in a number of campaigns
  and a number of battles. It never goes according to plan. The Battle of Gettysburg,
  for example, would certainly have been won by the Confederates if General Longstreet
  hadn’t drug his feet until it was too late.\nSY: What lesson do you draw from all
  this about the kind of people we ought to be? You have a vision that there are lots
  of choices, things don’t go according to plan, rules and laws can’t solve our problems
  because they can’t foresee everything. What kind of a person is going to be best
  in that kind of a world, filled with choices and uncertainties?\nGEK: The type of
  person that can analyze and make choices which we have to do in our society every
  day. Even grocery shopping, you have to make those sorts of choices. I very much
  think that it’s much better than having a system of law, for example, based upon
  the Continental system of published codes.\n[gap in recording]\n[Track 4]\n0:00\nSY:
  Mr. Justice, we’re continuing our conversation. It’s been a couple of months since
  we spoke and I think when we left off the last time, we had got you into law practice
  in southern Minnesota and then you were appointed to the Trial Court. Was becoming
  a judge something that you wanted to do? Had you sought out that position?\nGEK:
  Yes, I had always thought that that was a career I’d like to explore. I’d always
  had that idea in mind that I’d like to eventually end up as a judge, particularly
  as a trial judge. 34\nSY: What appealed to you about the position? It doesn’t pay
  that well.\nGEK: Well, no. But something appealed to me that I was very much interested
  in and a part of—the adversary system. But you were just that—an adversary—as a
  lawyer most of the time. To be able to rise above that adversary position and be
  able to analyze the thing from more or less an unbiased point of view appealed to
  me. I always thought I would enjoy that. And another thing. After twenty-two years
  of being chased around by clerks of court and having weekends and holidays spoiled
  and everything, I thought I’d like to be the one doing the chasing rather than the
  chase. [Laughs]\nSY: You mention that the adversary system didn’t give you a feeling
  that you’d come to the truth, let’s say. There are a lot of people who question
  the role of lawyers in society, saying they’re hired guns, that they’ll take any
  side. There is kind of a moral disdain for our adversary system. Do you actually
  sympathize with that criticism?\nGEK: I do not. I agree that it’s there but I do
  not sympathize with it. I feel that the adversary system really is very good and
  I have a great deal of admiration for somebody who will take a case that I know
  that the particular lawyer personally involved does not approve of the position
  he officially takes or she officially takes in court. Yet that lawyer just does
  a terrific job for his or her client, saying everything that ethically can be said
  in support of the client’s position and doing it forcefully and letting the decision-maker,
  who is the judge or the jury as the case may be, come up with the decision. I had
  a good example of that in the context of a moot trial after I came up here. [Unclear]
  personal injury lawyer had tried a medical malpractice case and done a very good
  job and that was his job. He routinely handled medical malpractice cases. But there
  was a very serious evidentiary question that came up, which he lost in the trial
  court. He came up here and we sustained the [unclear]. In the mock trial, he was
  assigned a position on the other side and he just did a beautiful job on the other
  side, even though you knew that personally, having read his brief up here, I knew
  what his real feelings were, but nonetheless, I thought he did a very professional
  job. His job was to say everything that ethically could 35\nbe said in favor of
  his client and he did so. It was just an excellent example of what I’m talking about.\n5:00\nSY:
  Which is the position that professionalism requires a distancing of yourself from
  your own beliefs and feelings, I guess. That you have a job to do and you’ve got
  to get on top of your own beliefs.\nGEK: That’s correct.\nSY: But a lot of people
  seem to feel that people can’t do that because that’s asking too much of people.\nGEK:
  I think that there is that feeling, but I would hope that it could be dispensed
  with because really, it’s not fair to the lawyer who is doing his job affording
  the poor and the unpopular with competent legal counsel. It’s not the lawyer’s job
  to make those moral decisions. It’s the job of the judges and the jurors or the
  bodies who our society gives that job to. It’s not the lawyers’.\nSY: I suppose,
  then, when we talk about criminal law that you hold to your position even more forcefully
  that a criminal—let’s assume someone really is guilty of the crime charged—still
  should have a lawyer who acts as if the person is innocent, even though that morally
  bothers a lot of citizens.\nGEK: Well, yes. Too frequently, it’s not a question
  of guilt or innocence. It’s a question about whether or not the arrival at that
  conclusion was done according to all the rules of the Constitution and law and protection
  set up for the freedom and so forth of the citizen. In this case a citizen who has
  been accused of a crime. In other words, before we send that person to prison for
  a long period of time, we better make darn sure that we send him there having followed
  all of our own rules. 36\nSY: So you are saying that the criminal justice system
  is not so much designed to separate out the guilty from the innocent in advance,
  but as a check on the government.\nGEK: As a check on the government and to make
  sure that the government proves the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A
  good many people may think, “Well, the guy’s guilty as sin,” but the question is,
  did the government prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. That’s the real question
  according to the rules of the Bill of Rights of the state and federal constitutions
  and so forth. I’m afraid a lot of the laypeople don’t appreciate that distinction,
  but it is a very important distinction.\nSY: I’d like to return to that with some
  questions for you about the rights that our Constitution gives to people accused
  of crime, but I’d like to get back to your appointment to the trial bench. Do you
  remember when you first heard that you were going to be made a judge and what were
  your feelings at that moment?\nGEK: Yes, I remember. I had mixed feelings. I was
  a partner in a firm and doing well and we had lived in the same community for twenty-two
  years and been active in it and it would mean that I’d have to leave that community.\nSY:
  Where were you working?\nGEK: In Austin.\nSY: And your appointment was where?\nGEK:
  My appointment was in the Third Judicial District and Austin is in the Third Judicial
  District but my chambers were going to be in Winona, which is a hundred miles away.
  And it would require a move to Winona. That’s the best thing that ever happened
  to me.\nSY: Why? 37\nGEK: Winona is a beautiful, beautiful area and there are a
  lot of wonderful people there and we enjoyed it there very much. Great place to
  raise kids.\nSY: Does Winona still have some of the tradition of being a river town?\nGEK:
  It’s a river town and I’m a river rat.\nSY: How does that make a difference in the
  culture of the people from Austin, which is more farming country and Hormel processing?\nGEK:
  Well, they are more laid back. They like jazz music and hiking in the bluffs and
  rivering it up and they are not quite so staid and organized. I don’t know. It’s
  hard to describe.\nSY: It’s not the traditional river boat gamblers, is it?\nGEK:
  Well, there might be a little bit of that, too.\nSY: Do you remember your first
  case, by any chance?\nGEK: Well, I do happen to remember it, if you’re talking about
  jury cases, because I had twenty-five of them in a row.\nSY: When you were a new
  judge, you had to do twenty-five jury trials?\n10:00\nGEK: Twenty-five jury trials.
  Condemnation cases for Interstate 90, which was going across southern Minnesota,
  one right after another. Going through Winona and Olmsted Counties.\nSY: So you
  learned about imminent domain law very quickly.\nGEK: I learned that instruction
  on the measure of damages and imminent domain so I didn’t even have to look at a
  piece of paper. 38\nSY: You mentioned instruction. What is that?\nGEK: Well, the
  instruction is the law that the trial judge gives the jury and the jury is bound
  to follow the law as given to it by the trial judge. The lawyers propose suggested
  instructions to the judge and the judge examines the proposals, does his or her
  own research and comes up with the instructions that he or she is going to give
  to the jury to guide them in their deliberations. Everybody has input into the process.
  The state, the defense, sometimes [unclear] and of course, the court. And before
  it’s given to the jury, the lawyers have an opportunity to make objections and so
  forth and so on to protect their record. But that is the law that guides the jury
  in arriving at its decision.\nSY: What flexibility does a trial judge have in giving
  the instructions?\nGEK: Not too much. If the instruction is proper, he or she should
  give it.\nSY: Which did you prefer, civil or criminal cases?\nGEK: Well, usually—not
  always—criminal cases were more, “interesting.” More dramatic. Not always. Sometimes
  there is a great deal of drama in a civil case. I didn’t have any real preference.\nSY:
  Did you feel that the legal system we have was adequate? Was it serving the needs
  of the communities that you knew?\nGEK: When I was a trial judge, a good share of
  that time we still had an emphasis on the fall concept in the tort area, particularly
  in automobile accident cases, which was pretty much eliminated in the seventies
  by no fault type insurance, arbitration and things of that nature. Before that time,
  the courts were just clogged with automobile accident cases about whether one vehicle
  reached the crosswalk two tenths of a second before one coming from right angles
  and that sort of thing and juries were deciding those questions. Now most of those
  are arbitrated under no fault principles and so forth and in that sense, I think
  that was good. Also, in the area of domestic relations. We also had fault concepts
  39\nin there. I’m not completely convinced that elimination of fault concepts in
  that area was a good thing.\nSY: You are talking primarily about divorce.\nGEK:
  Yes. I think that the concept or idea of fault may have or should have some bearing
  on collateral questions such as visitation rights with children, custody, support
  obligations and things of that nature. But at the present time, they really don’t
  because they’ve been eliminated by the legislature.\nSY: When you were a judge in
  the Third District in Winona, were you withdrawn and isolated from the community
  around you and from lawyers because you had to make decisions or would people come
  up to you on the street or come by your home and say, judge, I don’t like the system
  or I do like the system or can you help me on this, can you help me on that?\n15:00\nGEK:
  No, I didn’t feel I was isolated. Sometimes some people would call up and want to
  have advice. They’d say I need a lawyer or I’m getting a divorce or something, give
  me advice and I’d say I’m sorry, I can’t help you. There’s the yellow pages and
  the telephone book and you can look at that or you can talk to your other friends
  or somebody but I can’t do that. Once in a while, somebody’d ask you a legal question
  about a case that was pending or something and you’d have to politely explain to
  them why you couldn’t do so. But I didn’t feel that I was isolated from the community.
  Now, I personally tried not to be too buddy-buddy or cozy with the lawyers. I wasn’t
  rude to them but I didn’t really go fishing with them every weekend or something
  like that. I felt that while there was nothing really wrong with it, the appearance
  that there might be something wrong with it was bad and so I just didn’t do it.
  Didn’t socialize. I wouldn’t accept invitations to a lawyer’s house unless the entire
  bar was invited. If a lawyer was inviting the entire bar, which in a small community
  may be forty or fifty people, that’s\n40\none thing. But if they were just going
  to have some members of their firm and the local district judge there, no.\nSY:
  Why were you so concerned? What would people say?\nGEK: People would say, well,
  yeah, he ruled against me because he went to Dick Darby’s house for his cocktail
  party or lawn party or whatever it may be.\nSY: Now, are people really that suspicious?\nGEK:
  I think they are, yeah.\nSY: What you are describing, then, is the life of a judge
  which requires self-discipline and control similar to what you just mentioned about
  lawyers. You’d said a while back that lawyers have to control their feelings and
  do what’s right for the client. You’re saying a judge has to control his or her
  feelings and keep a certain amount of distance from some people. What about on the
  bench? Were there times when your emotions would tug you one way and the law or
  some duty would tug you another way?\nGEK: I’m sure that that was the case. You
  knew almost to a moral certainty that the accused was guilty as sin but sometimes
  the state didn’t have the proof to really nail it down beyond a reasonable doubt
  and sometimes a rule of evidence would interfere. I remember one time they had a
  big drug bust and they had twenty-two arrests or something like that and I told
  the prosecutor, “Choose the case you want to try first.” He chose the so called
  “kingpin” who was, at the time, considered to be the biggest importer of hard drugs
  into Minnesota. There was no question that he was guiltier than sin. However, he
  claimed entrapment.\nSY: That’s a legal doctrine.\nGEK: In other words, he said,
  “Yeah, I made the sale.” And it was a big sale, like 25,000 units or something involving
  $100,000 or so. He said, “Yeah, I made the sale, but 41\n20:00\nthe government agents,
  the police, entrapped me into it. They led me into it. I wouldn’t have done it if
  it hadn’t been for them.” And if the government, in fact, was guilty of entrapment,
  that is a defense. Well, they wanted to know that name of the government agent who
  had made the buy, the nark. I knew who it was, the defense attorney knew who it
  was, the defendant knew who it was, the prosecutor knew who it was, but it wasn’t
  official on the record. And so, eventually, under the United States Supreme Court
  decisions, I ruled that the state had to produce the name of the nark. Everybody
  knew it. The state took the position it would not do so. And so I took the position
  that either you do so or I’m going to dismiss this indictment. They didn’t do so.
  I dismissed it. Without the indictment, obviously, the guy got off. He threatened
  to kill a number of people including me. But there was a situation where your personal
  thoughts about the guilt or innocence of the individual interfered with what you
  duty was as a judge in enforcing the law. I thought the law was crazy. When everybody
  knew that Nick Siminski was the guy that made the buy. Everybody in southern Minnesota
  knew Nick Siminski. He’d been buying all over. But the defense lawyer in that case
  was doing what he had a right to do in saying I’ve got a right to know who that
  was so I can call him because he’s a witness and I have the right to have the witnesses
  against me be confronted in an open court under the Sixth Amendment. So that’s what
  I had to do.\n[Track 5]\n0:00\nSY: What were the judges like that you practiced
  before? What had their education been? What did they want from trial attorneys?\nGEK:
  Actually, I was very fortunate. When I first started out, Martin Nelson was the
  District Court Trial Judge in Austin and the judicial districts were a lot different
  then. You also presided in Fillmore and Freeborn County. Martin Nelson later came
  up here and was on the Supreme Court for a number of years. So he was the first
  District Judge that I worked under and he was a very good judge on evidence and
  those sorts of things. In 1952, we put in the so-called Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  and that streamlined the handling of law suits a great deal. The trial judges generally
  in southern Minnesota were 42\noutstanding in those days. They were good lawyers
  and I had good training under those judges all across Minnesota. There were a couple
  exceptions. There was one in Rochester that was pretty sad, but on the whole, they
  were very good. Axel Anderson in Owatonna was just outstanding. And the federal
  judges were good.\nSY: What were you doing in politics during the early fifties?
  I guess it was forty-eight before you came out.\nGEK: As a matter of fact, I did
  work on the Dewey campaign. But on a county level, working on some rallies and stuff
  like that. Later, I became secretary of the county party and then for about eight
  years was the county chairman down there and also district vice chairman. I just
  worked for the party generally.\nSY: Southern Minnesota was pretty Republican in
  those days, I would guess.\nGEK: In those days, it was. Yes. But not Mower County
  where Austin is. It was a very heavy labor town and very heavy DFL community.\nSY:
  Was Eisenhower popular where you were?\nGEK: Yes, I’d say he was, yes.\nSY: How
  did you go about trying to undercut Hubert Humphrey? He was a great man in Minnesota
  politics but on the other side of the fence.\nGEK: I never really tried to undercut
  him. I wasn’t that high up in the hierarchy. We would work for the other candidate
  but we didn’t go out and give speeches or anything like that. We let the politicians
  do that.\nSY: So you never considered yourself a politician.\nGEK: No. 43\nSY: What
  is the function of someone like yourself who is very involved in party organization
  but is not a politician? What rewards do you get from that kind of work?\nGEK: You
  are working for people that you believe have programs that would benefit the state
  and you are helping to get the message they have out. You are helping to get the
  people that support them out to vote for them so they get a chance to do what they
  want to do. You help to raise the money that is the lifeblood of all political campaigns
  and those types of tasks. I was urged a number of times to run for public office
  but I refused.\nSY: Why was that?\nGEK: I’d rather have something to do with who
  is elected than be the electee.\nSY: Why, though?\nGEK: Oh, it’s a lot of work to
  run and I just didn’t care to do so.\nSY: But that tradition of famous Americans
  that you talked about before that influenced you, they were political leaders. Hamilton,
  Washington, Lincoln, those people.\nGEK: Also, one reason for it, too, Steve, was
  that ninety percent of my practice was civil litigation. I didn’t want to get too
  involved in partisan political activity so as to jeopardize my utility to the firm
  in handling all their civil litigation.\n5:00\nSY: There are people who say that
  the law and politics are really the same thing and it’s just all a question of who
  wins the election and who’s got power and that you can’t really use the law against
  the powerful political leader. Do you agree with that?\nGEK: No, I do not.\nSY:
  A lot of people believe it. 44\nGEK: An example, at the highest level is the President
  of the United States—a rather powerful person— who was forced to leave office by
  the law.\nSY: You are referring to Nixon.\nGEK: Right.\nSY: Did you see just in
  your career in the fifties in Austin with politics, did you ever see the law of
  the judges and politics intermingling in an unfair or abusive way?\nGEK: I can’t
  ever say that I did. We’re very fortunate in Minnesota to have a clean political
  climate—lots cleaner than lots of other states.\nSY: What accounts for that?\nGEK:
  I suppose it goes back to our German and Scandinavian people who primarily settled
  the state, coming here with their moralistic ideals and so forth. I think that tradition
  is in Minnesota politics. It’s been that way and we like to keep it that way.\nSY:
  In the mid 1960’s, this country had the civil rights revolution. In the fifties
  and early sixties, what was your sense of what was going to happen with civil rights,
  the whole burst of protection of individual rights? Did you see it coming? Did you
  think we needed it? Was it an issue in Austin?\nGEK: I’ll never forget when I was
  in the Army in 1944, 1943, down in Monroe, Louisiana, they had one of the most beautiful
  high schools I’d ever seen up until that time. And about four blocks away, they
  had an old unpainted building that covered every grade from kindergarten to high
  school where seventy percent of the population—black-- sent their children to school.
  The inequality in the type of education that was being afforded on a physical basis
  was just egregious. And with World War II, where the mostly southern black soldiers
  came back and you sensed that something was going to happen and had to happen and
  should have happened and has happened. 45\nSY: The famous case of Brown versus Board
  of Education, 1954-55. Did that have much of an impact on the law and politics in
  Minnesota?\nGEK: In the area that I was in at that time, I can say no, it had none,
  because I doubt that in those days, outside the Twin Cities area, there probably
  weren’t a hundred black people in Minnesota. Maybe a few in Duluth, but there were
  none down in the area where I lived.\nSY: Where there any minority people of any
  kind?\nGEK: Yes. They had Mexican laborers come in to a nearby community called
  Hollingdale. Hollingdale consisted of some drained lakes and they do a lot of vegetable
  farming down there. A lot of these itinerant Mexican workers came down and worked
  the vegetable crop. There were minorities there. And there were also Indians in
  certain pockets of southern Minnesota.\nSY: Did you ever have an Indian or immigrant
  worker as a client or have to sue them?\nGEK: Yes. When I was a trial judge in the
  extreme southeastern corner of Minnesota, we’d get Indians sometimes in the court.\nSY:
  Any particular litigants, either your clients or on the other side, come to mind
  as being particularly colorful or the source of a good story or two?\n10:00\nGEK:
  No, I can’t think of any at the moment. I’m sure there were some but I can’t think
  of any.\nSY: As a civil trial lawyer, did you form any judgments about whether the
  system that you were a part of was a good system or not?\nGEK: Well, of course I
  felt it was a good system. I thought then, perhaps more so than I think today, that
  the way the civil law system was administered in Minnesota was superior to administrative
  type hearings, arbitration, mediation and things of that nature. 46\nI might have
  somewhat different viewpoints on that today in certain areas, but I still think
  in the area of tort litigation it’s preferable to something along the line of workers’
  compensation, for example. More likely to reach the ephemeral target, justice, than
  you do on a rigid code of rules such as the workers’ compensation law.\nSY: Do you
  see the principal difference in the presentation of evidence or the funding mechanism?\nGEK:
  Well, there is a lot to be said for the common law rules of evidence. In too many
  of these administrative type hearings, they kind of toss the common law rules of
  evidence out and hearsay and everything else is admitted and given weight. I think
  there’s a lot to be said for cross examination and all those things. Generally speaking,
  I felt, with exceptions, that juries did a remarkable job of arriving at a substantially
  correct conclusion.\nSY: Even when you ended up on the losing side?\nGEK: Even when
  I was on the losing side. What is the losing side? If I couldn’t settle a case for
  $50,000 and the jury brought in a verdict against me for $25,000 I was happy as
  heck. So, you have to ask, what is the losing side?\nSY: This gets back again to
  your sense that truth is hard to find.\nGEK: Right.\nSY: Why, then, does the workers’
  comp system appeal to you?\nGEK: Just for that reason. For example, it’s typical
  in workers’ comp cases that the attending physician or an examining physician doesn’t
  appear at all. He writes a letter and they admit that in evidence. There’s no cross
  examination to test the conclusions that he’s arrived at and so forth. The same
  thing is true with documentation to support lost wages and that sort of thing. Moreover,
  there is a temptation to—and it’s 47\n15:00\nhappened—as I said, twenty years ago,
  I did a lot of workers’ compensation work. The legislators fool around with our
  statutes so much that you wouldn’t know that it’s the same compensation law that
  I dealt with twenty-five years ago, which I knew pretty well. Now they’ve got so
  many exceptions and sub-sections and cross-sections and so forth, it’s a maze. It’s
  like trying to get through the Internal Revenue Code just to follow. A little problem
  comes up that the law doesn’t cover so they enact another little amendment to the
  statute and by the time they add all those up, you got a code that’s about that
  thick instead of a relatively simple system that started out thirty, forty, fifty
  years ago.\nSY: I’m hearing you say that that experience reinforces your sense that
  it’s hard to come up with laws, rules and regulations to take care of many, many
  contingencies.\nGEK: Right. I think so. When I first started practicing law, we
  could have all the rules of court in Minnesota in about a twenty-five page pamphlet.
  Now, just the book of rules governing the operation of the courts are three inches
  thick and somebody’s always saying there’s not a rule to cover this and so then
  they go and have another rules hearing and put another rule in there.\nSY: Why do
  you think we’ve shifted to look for more and more rules as a solution to problems?\nGEK:
  I don’t know. But it’s certainly happened. I keep reminding my colleagues that we
  have too many rules already, but we still keep grinding them out.\nSY: That search
  for certainty, I suppose. I’m still not clear, Mr. Justice, between the tort trial
  system versus the workers’ comp administrative system. Do you come down very strongly
  in favor of one over the other?\nGEK: We’re going back in time now. Back in the
  fifties, yes, I would then. I’m not so sure today. I’m sure you’re familiar with
  the writings of Professor Sugarman at the University of California who advocates
  a system somewhat along the lines of workers’ compensation system that is government
  sponsored and with government schedules for 48\ninjuries as being more efficient,
  quicker and less costly and less wasteful and so forth. He’s got some good points.\nSY:
  So even though you’d be concerned about watering down the rules of evidence in that
  system, on balance, you think that kind of a system might be an improvement.\nGEK:
  I’m not sure I’m that far yet. In 1986 I wrote part of an ABA article to rebut Professor
  Sugarman’s thesis and since 1986, I’ve started to waver a little bit in the certainty
  that I then had. I think the tort system today has been stretched beyond what was
  contemplated developmentally by the common law when you get in these massive catastrophe
  type torts, you get into class actions and all that stuff.\nSY: Where there are
  thousands of plaintiffs or something like that. In your study of history and your
  reflections, what was the tort system originally designed to accomplish?\nGEK: I
  think that tort system essentially evolved from the criminal law. The criminal law
  was in favor of the crown and it evolved to give the victims of wrongdoing some
  compensation. I think it’s more a matter of individual on individual rather than
  these things that probably should be governed in the reparation system by a system.
  I haven’t quite reached that point yet and I haven’t quite thought it all the way
  through, but Sugarman’s got some good ideas and some good points. They can’t be
  discounted.\nSY: So what you’re saying as we sit here in January of 1990 is that
  a tort system with lawyers arguing before a judge bringing in evidence works pretty
  well one on one. One plaintiff against one defendant.\nGEK: Or even further than
  that—involving one incident.\nSY: One airplane crash where 300 people are killed.
  So you have 300 plaintiffs in that case.\n20:00\nGEK: When you get into these toxic
  torts and so forth where you have thousands of 49\nwomen buying thousands of products
  and they don’t even know what kind of product they’ve bought and you get into the
  market share theories and all that sort of thing, I think they’re stretching the
  tort system beyond what it was originally designed or meant to be. When they do
  that, I don’t think it’s as efficient as it is in the type of thing that we were
  talking about earlier.\nSY: So you’re prepared now to think about a very different
  kind of system for coming up with the compensation for people who are hurt or injured.\nGEK:
  I think it’s worth exploring. I’m not saying that’s the answer but it’s worth exploring.\nSY:
  Thank you, Mr. Justice.\n[Track 6]\n[Photographs and general conversation not relevant
  to interview.]\n[Track 7]\n0:00\nGEK: I grew up in the Midwest and I wanted to remain
  the Midwest and at that time, my in-laws were still alive and my wife and I didn’t
  want to go back to our home town particularly because people would think of us as
  the kids who sold peanuts in the ball park and so forth and so on, which isn’t too
  good for a lawyer, or wasn’t in those days. During the Depression days and the Dust
  Bowl days, when I was traveling around representing colleges in debate and athletics
  and so forth, why it always seemed like the corn was a little taller and a little
  greener in southern Minnesota than it was in South Dakota and so I decided I’d like
  to practice law in rural Illinois, Iowa or Minnesota. That’s how I ended up here.\nSY:
  Someone told me that when you took the bar exam, you weren’t sure you’d passed so
  you didn’t interview for a legal job. 50\nGEK: The bar exam in those days was a
  lot different than it is today. It was an essay type, twenty minutes of questions,
  three days, eight hours a day of writing essays on various subjects. And it was
  not a nationwide bar exam like they have today. There was no true-false multiple
  choice type questions and it was very much different. I had applied for jobs but
  after I took the bar, I was so uncertain about it that I expanded my search for
  a job. I had a wife I figured I had to support and so I applied to some insurance
  companies who, at that time, were hiring young lawyers. Many young lawyers went
  to work for nothing in those days, Steve, just in order to get an office. They didn’t
  get these $40,000 salaries like they do today. The top guy on pay that went out
  of my law school class got $5,000 a year. The top man. And so, I started applying
  for a job as an insurance adjuster in some of the insurance companies in the Twin
  Cities. As it turned out, I got an offer for a job which I took in Austin, and even
  so, I didn’t move all my furnishings down there until after I got the results of
  the bar exam.\nSY: Again, a note of caution, realizing that many have slipped between
  the cup and the lip. How did you end up in Austin as opposed to Wabasha or Rochester
  or Albert Lea?\nGEK: When I was in law school, there was a fellow student of mine
  was there who, before the war, was a school teacher and he had taught in Austin
  and Austin had an excellent school system and also when I was going to college,
  I worked in the grocery trade for all the time I was going to college and actually
  was assistant manager of a grocery store during part of the time I was going to
  college and so I was very much familiar with the George A. Hormel company in Austin
  who were the pioneers in Spam.\nSY: Had you been eating some Spam in World War II?\nGEK:
  I’d eaten plenty of what they called Spam. It wasn’t Spam but everybody called it
  that. So I was familiar with the George A. Hormel Company and what a great company
  it was and how stable the economy of the Austin area was. So when I was looking
  for a job I looked all over Minnesota-- Duluth and St. Cloud and Owatonna. One 51\nof
  the places I interviewed at in Owatonna they said, well, there’s a firm down in
  Austin that was looking for somebody about six months ago so I went down and interviewed
  that firm.\nSY: Did you have a car at this point? Did you take busses?\nGEK: I had
  a car.\nSY: Model? Something made right after the war or an old prewar car?\n5:00\nGEK:
  I had a used 1946 car. This was in forty-eight when I got out.\nSY: Were they still
  making all the cars black? Or did you have a colored car?\nGEK: I had a black one.
  They didn’t make them all black but I had a black one. So I went down there and
  eventually, that’s where I decided to go. I had a choice between there and Algin,
  Illinois and Algin, Illinois was just too close to Chicago. Now, today, you can’t
  tell where one starts and one ends.\nSY: How would you get introductions to a law
  firm in a small town in those days?\nGEK: Well, Steve, one great thing, fortunately,
  the University of Michigan Law School had an excellent reputation in the Midwest
  and that was the best way to get an introduction. One way I went into many law firms
  is to get Martindale Hubbell out and look up--\nSY: What is Martindale Hubbell?\nGEK:
  Martindale Hubbell is a directory of lawyers and it tells, among other things, where
  they went to undergraduate and where they went to law school. So if they had a firm
  member in there that went to the University of Michigan, that was my entrée. 52\nSY:
  You’d give them a call and say, “Just graduated from your law school and I’d like
  to come talk to you.”\nGEK: I had a resume with me and some letters of recommendation
  from faculty and what have you.\nSY: How did you find the lawyers in Minnesota?
  Were they interested? Were they cold?\nGEK: Yes, it was tough in those days. I told
  you that a third of the members of my class went out and went to work for law firms
  for nothing. They got office space and the right to use the telephone and then after
  they showed that they could do something, they’d start paying them a little bit.
  A good salary was a couple hundred dollars a month.\nSY: So you ultimately ended
  up with an introduction to an Austin law firm. Did you like them right off the bat?\nGEK:
  Yes, I did. They had a diverse practice and it was a small firm, only four or five
  lawyers, but they tried to specialize to a certain extent and I liked that and I
  enjoyed it and they treated me well.\nSY: Was there anything in particular that
  got you the job as opposed to the next young lawyer with a degree and a resume and
  a lot of hope?\nGEK: Well, one of the senior partners there had gone to the University
  of Michigan Law School. I suppose that didn’t hurt. Incidentally, he went to the
  university law school after he had been admitted to the bar in Minnesota. He’d taken
  the bar after reading the law in a law office and then he went to law school after
  he’d been admitted.\nSY: It may be apropos, but I understand Frank B. Kellogg, who
  was a senator and a famous lawyer came from Austin or Rochester or somewhere? 53\nGEK:
  He didn’t come from Austin.\nSY: Because he read for the bar, too. I don’t think
  he ever went to law school. It occurs to me that in recent decades, most young people
  from your background in smaller towns, rural towns, going to law school want to
  end up in a big city somewhere—New York, Chicago, Paris maybe. They don’t want to
  go back to a smaller community. Was everybody different in those days or were you
  different from a lot of people?\nGEK: I think I was different. When I got out of
  law school, I was offered a job at the legal department of the Michigan Central
  Railroad, which was a subsidiary of the New York Central System in Detroit. I was
  offered the job but I had to go in for a final interview with the General Counsel
  and Vice President in Detroit. It was on the top floor of the Michigan Central Building
  and on three sides was glass and you’d look out over all that smoke and stuff that
  was Detroit back in 1948 and I had to wait a while and by the time I got in to see
  the fellow, I said, “I don’t want to waste your time, sir. I’ve made up my mind.
  I’m not interested in the job. I don’t want to live here.” He said, “Sit down. I
  want to talk to you. I came from North Dakota. I wish I’d made that decision thirty-five
  years ago.” We chatted for quite a while. I didn’t want to live in a large city.
  I enjoyed the outdoors too much—the hunting and fishing and all that sort of stuff
  and I didn’t want to be too far away from it.\nSY: Do you remember your first case
  in Austin?\nGEK: Yes.\nSY: What was it?\n10:00\nGEK: I was appointed to represent
  a couple who had been going across southern Minnesota writing a lot of checks and
  they didn’t have all the constitutional safeguards they have now with Rasmussen
  hearings and Omnibus hearings and all that sort of thing. The judge called me up
  and says I’ve got a couple of people, it’s this afternoon, I want you to come over
  and represent them. So I went over there and the woman was 54\nobviously very pregnant.
  Very pregnant. And so, I thought, well, I might get her off because of her condition
  until I asked her whose name she signed the checks in. She’d signed the checks and
  the fellow she was with had passed them-- the father of her child to be. She got
  mad at him so he signed his name to the checks. Well, that wasn’t so good so then
  I turned to the fellow and I asked him about his background and I found out he’d
  been in the navy and that was right after World War II and the judges were sometimes
  a little sympathetic to the ex-servicemen getting adjusted and so, I thought I had
  a chance with him until I found out he had a dishonorable discharge for stealing
  government goods. That was my first case.\nSY: How well did you do?\nGEK: Well,
  if you judge it by whether or not they were convicted and served time, they did.
  They were both convicted and served time. As a matter of fact, the woman was taken
  from the county jail to the hospital to have her baby a couple days later. But they
  were both in jail.\nSY: A lot of people wonder, not reflecting on our Constitution,
  why should known criminals have a lawyer? A lot of lawyers get uncomfortable representing
  somebody that they know has done some heinous act. How did you feel about that?\nGEK:
  I take the position I think most lawyers take, that under our system a person shouldn’t
  pay the penalties of the criminal law unless the state can prove beyond a reasonable
  doubt that the accused did the crime and committed the crime and the legislature
  in enacting the criminal statutes and the courts that interpret them, the Constitution.
  It is the duty of the defense attorney to see that the state touches all the proper
  bases and does things according [unclear] so there’s no doubt about it when a person
  is deprived of liberty or of property that they’ve been afforded all the rights
  that the law and the Constitution permits. That doesn’t bother me that I personally
  might feel that the person was “guilty.” 55\nSY: So your role as a lawyer really
  wasn’t related to the moral quality of those defendants, but it was much more related
  to the integrity of the political system.\nGEK: I think so. I represented people
  that I loathed as a person. But I felt that as a human being they had a right to
  have all the protection the law afforded and it was my job to see they got it.\nSY:
  Any of those clients you can tell us about without revealing names or anything?
  Why would you ever loathe a person?\nGEK: Well, they were creeps. Let’s put it that
  way. They did things like molest children or take advantage of old people or something
  like that. But I think every lawyer who has done any criminal work has done that.
  I didn’t do a lot of criminal work, but I did do some.\nSY: What was Austin like
  in the late forties when you were there and what did your wife think about it and
  did you have children right away?\nGEK: Well, Austin was a good town and it was
  a town that hadn’t had any labor problems for many, many years. It was a town of
  very high home ownership, something over eighty-five percent of the people owned
  their own homes and they took good care of them since they did own them. It was
  a clean town. It had an excellent school system, good churches. It was education
  minded. It had a junior college along before World War II and they are very much
  education oriented town. It was a very Democratic town. You might be a hog skinner
  who lived right next door to the company president. There were no sections of town
  where the executives lived and the workers lived and that sort of thing. It was
  a very delightful place to live. That was one reason that I went there, because
  I knew something about it from this friend in law school who had taught school there.\nSY:
  You’d had some previous contact with Austin. 56\n15:00\nGEK: Yes. At about the same
  time that I went there, the Hormel Company was hiring a lot of young engineers and
  accountants and so forth, coming out of school after World War II and so there were
  a lot of young people about my age who now have gone through the ranks and become
  executives and are retired and I’m still working but nevertheless, there was a good
  group of people to socialize with. I enjoyed it very much.\nSY: How did you consult
  with your wife about moving to Austin? Did she know much about it?\nGEK: She knew
  nothing about it. A packing house town as they existed in those days smelled. Packing
  houses smell. And the first night we were in town, one of our firm members invited
  us to a social affair, a dinner where there was a speaker and when we came out of
  the church, the wind had changed and we got the packing house smell and she went
  home and cried all night. Living in that place. She was more of a—as they say in
  the play Oklahoma, she wanted to go where the cement grows in the big city. But
  she got to love it and we still consider that home today.\nSY: How many children
  do you have, Mr. Justice?\nGEK: I have three.\nSY: Were they all born in the early
  fifties?\nGEK: No. One was born in fifty-five; one in sixty and one in sixty-five.
  Five years apart.\nSY: How does a young man develop a law practice in Austin in
  1950?\nGEK: It’s a lot different than today. Today they have advertising and all
  that sort of thing and those were all prohibited in those days, as you know. But
  you work in community activities and church activities and things like that. I taught
  Sunday School and I was in the Junior Chamber of Commerce and served on school committees
  and in 57\nthe Elks Club and the American Legion and in the Red Cross and because
  County Chairman of the Red Cross, for example. I got involved some in politics.\nSY:
  What were then people looking for in a young lawyer? As they saw you doing these
  things in the community, were they testing your judgment, whether you were a friendly
  person or they just wanted to see how you would wear?\nGEK: I think probably that
  was the way lawyers built their practice. They’d go out and they’d do a good job,
  for example, on a fund drive or if you were, say, chairman of the local Red Cross,
  you were doing a good job of handling the affairs and they kind of form their opinion
  of you, whether they want to entrust their legal matters to you or not. That’s the
  way you built up a practice in those days. Work on church committees and so forth.\nSY:
  What flexibility did you have over the kind of practice you were building?\nGEK:
  We had our firm sort of specialized and because one of the senior partners who did
  all the trial work got rather ill shortly after I came there, all of a sudden, I
  was thrust into doing a very heavy civil trial load. And that’s the niche I fell
  into. I really didn’t start out planning to do that. So for twenty-two years I was
  pretty much a civil trial lawyer, although I did some estate work and some other
  work, too. Some municipal work, but real estate, the field I really was interested
  in when I started out, I probably did practically nothing in.\nSY: You couldn’t
  get back to Henry II.\nGEK: I couldn’t get into season and all those concepts.\nSY:
  Did you do plaintiffs work or defendants work?\nGEK: I did both, but the bulk was
  on the defendant’s side. 58\nSY: And who were your clients, primarily?\nGEK: Well,
  we represented the George A. Hormel Company. We were their in-house counsel at that
  time and I did most of their—they were mostly self-insured. I did most of their
  legal work in Minnesota.\nSY: I’m sorry. What does it mean to be self-insured?\nGEK:
  They don’t buy insurance policies. They have a reserve on their books and they accept
  the loss.\nSY: So if somebody sues them and wins, they have to pay the money. They
  just don’t have an insurance company that’ll pay it.\n20:00\nGEK: No insurance company
  to indemnify them or to afford them a defense. Also, under the workers’ compensation
  law, they were self-insured and any case that got into litigation—now they handled
  a lot of workers’ compensation matters that never got into litigation in house.
  But any case that got into litigation, I handled for them. And then, as a result
  of that, I suppose, I did a lot of insurance company defense work. Mostly civil
  cases in those days and the courts were filled with them. Or automobile accident
  cases with no fault insurance which came in about the early seventies eliminated
  a good many of those types of cases.\nSY: So if there was an automobile accident
  in southern Minnesota, the insurance company which it insured one of the parties
  might hire you as the local lawyer to defend in that local court. What courts did
  you practice before?\nGEK: The district courts primarily in Minnesota. District
  courts were different in those days than they are now. And the United States District
  Courts. Primarily those two courts.\nSY: And the U.S. District Court would have
  been up in the Twin Cities, I take it? 59\nGEK: When I first started, the United
  States District Court set in Mankato and Winona, Fergus Falls, Duluth and someplace
  else. Now it only sits in St. Paul and Minneapolis and Duluth.\n[Track 8]\n0:00\nSY:
  That experience, with that criminal trial doesn’t sound like it was very enjoyable.
  The job of being a judge may not be that easy. If that’s true, what kind of a person
  makes the best judge?\nGEK: Judge Devitt, the United States District Court Judge
  here in the District of Minnesota who has been a trial judge for many, many years—35
  years or more, is, in my opinion, one of the best trial judges that I ever went
  up against as a lawyer or as a judge and he wrote a book or a monograph about the
  qualities of a trial judge. He listed a number of things which the judge should
  do but they pretty much all added up to one word: patience. You have to be patient.
  You can get awful discouraged with some [unclear] that keeps droning on on a hot
  afternoon, putting the jury to sleep and the judge to sleep and everything else.
  You have to be patient, to let each party present his or her evidence, his or her
  arguments fully and completely. You still can use some discretion in limiting repetition
  and that sort of thing but you’ve got to make sure that you are not foreclosing
  that party from presenting everything that legitimately can be presented for consideration
  by the fact-finder or the decision-maker, which is the judge or the jury. I always
  tried to keep in mind two things. I have a little sign that I drew once when I was
  doodling. It’s sitting right over there. See it? “Patience.”\nSY: Just patience.\nGEK:
  And I drew that and I did it on the bench and when I left court that evening, the
  bailiff, who was almost 93 or 94 years old but in remarkably good physical health,
  picked it up and took it home and framed and it and he gave it to me the next Christmas
  and I’ve kept it either on my bench when I was a trial judge or here on that shelf
  since I’ve been 60\nup here. I think that’s good to have patience, to listen out
  the parties and hear their arguments and not to jump to conclusions too early.\nAnother
  motto or phrase that I always kept foremost in my mind is “Not who, but what is
  right.” And I found that to be helpful that you may have somebody that you have
  distaste for but that doesn’t mean that he or she shouldn’t win that particular
  point.\nSY: What is your response to the culture of the sixties and seventies which
  says, basically, if you think it, it’s okay, if you want to say it, you should say
  it and if you want to do it, go ahead and do it. In other words, that your life
  should not be structured by patience and discipline and control and listening to
  other people, fitting into a system, that you need to sort of “take charge” of your
  surroundings and impose your own views and feelings whenever you want.\nGEK: I don’t
  think much of that. That’s not the job of the judge. If he or she wants to do that,
  run for the legislature.\nSY: Were there any civil trials involving divorces or
  accidents or contract disputes which were emotionally difficult or contentious for
  you as a person and how did you handle that?\n5:00\nGEK: Yes. The most difficult
  ones were in the early seventies with the school consolidations and closings. Now
  the matter of the rural schools in these small communities were a matter of extreme
  emotional concern to the residents of the area, the parents of the children who
  were going to be affected, the taxpayers, not only the children who might go to
  one school district or the other but the affect upon the school district that they
  take them from, which has to do with state aids and a whole bunch of other things.
  Very strong emotions. Lots of letters to the editor and that sort of thing. Probably
  the type of dispute that could be better resolved on an administrative level than
  in the district court process, but it was relegated at that time is generally yet
  today to the court process on a theory somewhat in the nature of [unclear]. Those
  were very 61\ndramatic. Contrary to most civil cases when you might have seven or
  eight or ten people in the courtroom, you’d have hundreds in the courtroom when
  you had one of these school consolidation cases or whether or not they should build
  a new courthouse or remodel the old one or those types of public but still civil
  issues.\nSY: What was the issue you had to decide in the school consolidation cases?\nGEK:
  Whether or not the particular board that was set up—I forget the name of the board
  at the time—to look into these things and make the recommendation the school board
  adopted. Whether they had followed due process and allowed everybody to present
  and whether they’d given full weight to the issues. It was a terrific issue.\nSY:
  Was it mostly procedural or were you called upon to assess the rightness of the
  final decision?\nGEK: We were called upon to decide whether or not the decision
  of the decision-maker was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Now you, as a lawyer,
  know that that’s a decision that you’re making. It’s your guess against theirs.
  But if there is any evidence to sustain their decision, the law generally would
  require the trial judge to sustain it, even though he or she may disagree with you.\nSY:
  Again, it’s another example of the need for a kind of discipline and control and
  saying, “I wouldn’t have decided it that way, but they did and it was their job.”\nGEK:
  For example, in the school case, I decided the case the way that I wouldn’t have
  decided had I been part of the decision but I had to concede that there was sufficient
  evidence to sustain the findings made by this interim board that was set up under
  the law at that time.\nSY: Do you have any thoughts or advice for people as to what
  you can do in your own life to get that kind of discipline and build the ability
  to be patient? 62\nGEK: I think that it’s just something that’s acquired by a law
  student by the time they matriculate in law school through their entire legal career,
  particularly if they are following the litigation route. They learn to expect that.
  They expect that from their judges and they expect that if they are going to become
  a judge, that they are going to have to do that. I think that’s the way it works.
  I’m not sure.\nSY: So it is a question of experience. It’s not intellectual. It’s
  not something you get by reading books.\nGEK: I’m not saying that, either. I think
  that might have a great bearing on it, but I think it’s all of life’s experience,
  the way the system works. It can’t work if you have impartial, biased people making
  the decisions, unreviewable by anybody else. We want a system where it’s fair to
  everybody and I think that’s imbued in the law student and the law schools and through
  their training and the ethics and so forth. If and when the opportunity comes for
  one of them to become a judge, they just kind of naturally fall into that.\nSY:
  Does enjoyment of history help you gain this kind of patience and tolerance?\n10:00\nGEK:
  Well, it did me. That’s all I can say. I think one can learn an awful lot from history.
  We have the example of John Marshall, whose picture hangs behind me here in this
  office. In several instances during his career, he had to make decisions which were
  against his or his family’s own interest in Northern Virginia but he seemed to be
  able to do so. On the other hand, we have the example of Chief Justice Taney of
  the United States Supreme Court who followed John Marshall who admittedly and publicly
  announced that he was put on the Supreme Court of the United States to protect the
  institution of slavery and he did so in the Dred Scott Decision, which was a very
  great, if not the greatest cause of the breakout of fighting in the Civil War. So
  there are two examples, one of what you should do and one of what you shouldn’t
  do as a judge.\nSY: What did you think of the lawyers who appeared before your court
  in Winona? 63\nGEK: On the whole, they were very good. Of course, some of the younger
  lawyers didn’t have experience. You had to be more patient with them and sometimes
  call them in and make suggestions to them— Hey, you forgot to prove up damages or
  you forgot this or that. If you want me to reopen the case, I will to give you an
  opportunity to do so or something like that. But on the whole, it was a good bar.
  Hardworking, competent, able and a good bar can make a mediocre judge look good.
  And maybe that’s what they did.\nSY: I doubt that. Is the stereotype of the country
  lawyer, the raconteur before the jury, the good old boy kind of approach accurate?\nGEK:
  I certainly don’t think so in 1990. I think in 1965, it might have been. One of
  the most successful trial lawyers in southern Minnesota, boy he had a way with those
  farmer juries. He could talk their language. He could take a sow’s ear and make
  a silk purse out of it. But I don’t think he’d have that success today.\nSY: Is
  that because the lawyers have changed or the people of changed who sit on juries?\nGEK:
  Both, I think. People have become more sophisticated by watching television and
  that sort of thing. In the sixties in rural Minnesota, there wasn’t very much television
  until the latter half of the sixties, at least. And that flamboyance doesn’t go
  across so much anymore. Some of those farm people are pretty sophisticated with
  their Cadillacs and Lincolns and hundred thousand dollar piece of farm equipment
  and so forth and they don’t buy this down to earth humor.\nSY: As a judge, what
  did you do if there was a very bad lawyer working for a client before you and you
  could tell that the lawyer was hurting the client’s interest?\nGEK: You did whatever
  you could. I remember one time, I had a criminal case and the lawyer was just horrible.
  Just horrible. The jury convicted his client, of course. I figured if that case
  came up to the Supreme Court, here, that there would certainly be 64\n15:00\nreversed
  for inadequacy of counsel. Well, I didn’t really want to hold out in public for
  the newspaper to say that he was inadequate, but they had been arrested in Olmsted
  County for some other burglaries. I thought, well, I’ll send him over there for
  trial for sentencing. And whatever they sentence him over there, I’ll make my sentence
  run concurrently. Well, he went over there but they let him out before they sentenced
  him and he committed some more burglaries. So they sent him back to me for sentencing
  for the first one. Well, there was only one thing I could do, which was to set aside
  his conviction in Wabasha County because there was just no way that would get by
  the Supreme Court. It was such a bad case of representation. It was terrible. I
  called him in and I called the lawyer in afterwards and apologized for what I had
  to do. But I said, God, you just sold your guy down the river. You didn’t give him
  any defense whatsoever. And he had a good defense! That was the other thing. He
  had a good defense. The victim of his robbery happened to be his girlfriend’s father.
  And there was some question about whether he had consent to go in the place. So,
  at any rate, he went out to Albuquerque, New Mexico and became a prosecutor. I’m
  not sure how successful he was after he went out there but at least he wasn’t around
  us.\nSY: Since you’ve joined the Supreme Court, you have participated on the work
  of the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board, which supervises the discipline
  of lawyers in Minnesota. Are you satisfied that that board is doing all that it
  can to keep the bar in Minnesota at the highest standards of excellence?\nGEK: I
  think it’s doing an excellent job. I suppose that you can’t ever say that any board
  is doing all that it could because you are talking about resources and finances.
  It should be kept in mind that the lawyers disciplinary system in Minnesota is solely
  financed by the lawyers. It is not tax financed at all. The lawyers voluntarily
  pay fees which the Supreme Court allocates to the lawyers board, pays the staff
  attorneys and the staff people and so what they can do is limited by their finances
  to a great deal. We have an excellent director at the present time, good personnel
  operator and they are doing a good job. And the volume has increased tremendously
  and it’s very sickening to see 65\nyoung people spend literally hundreds of thousands
  of dollars getting a legal education and all that time and effort and work and then
  to throw it aside by some stupid, unethical conduct. It’s really very discouraging.
  But they are doing a good job. They are doing about the best job they can under
  the circumstances.\nSY: What are the most common mistakes that lawyers make or complaints
  that are brought against them?\nGEK: Procrastination is one. That usually is not
  of sufficient importance to justify disbarment, but it does justify discipline.
  What really justifies disbarment is if they get their hand in the till. And sole
  practitioner, young lawyers out of practice seven or eight years or less, are the
  ones who run into problems of this nature and it’s sad. It really is.\nSY: Do you
  see much problem with chemical dependency and alcohol or drugs among lawyers?\nGEK:
  I don’t know what much is, but we see some, yes. And frequently they will come in
  and say, yeah, I did procrastinate. I did not communicate with my client. I did
  not communicate with the court. I lied to my client about what I’ve done with the
  court, and so forth. But that was because I’m suffering from depression, alcoholism,
  chemical dependency and so forth and I’ve taken steps to address that by going to
  Hazelden or wherever and yes, we do get quite a bit of that.\nSY: Do you feel that
  in general, the standards of the bar are the same, higher or lower than when you
  started out in practice?\nGEK: My own personal opinion is that they are lower. For
  one thing, when I started out, they didn’t have the professionalism they have today
  in the sense that it was absolutely forbidden for us to advertise our services in
  any way. Now you pick up a telephone book in Austin and look at the yellow pages,
  and half of the lawyers in there are Twin Cities lawyers soliciting business down
  in southeastern Minnesota. Personal 66\ninjury cases and things of that nature.
  I think that that’s demeaning of the profession. I’m old fashioned in that regard.\nSY:
  Doesn’t it provide better service to consumers, though?\nGEK: That’s the argument
  of the consumers group. I’m not so sure that it does. I don’t think that necessarily
  follows. It may, but I’m not sure it always does.\n[Track 9]\n0:00\nSY: Mr. Justice,
  I understand that you once spent about twelve weeks as a trial judge on just one
  case. It was Miller versus Miller, I think. What made that case take such a long
  time?\nGEK: Well, it had its genesis in the immigration of a Russian Jew to the
  United States shortly after World War I. This immigrant brought with him a wife
  and several young children and engaged in the rag business in southern Minnesota.
  In those days, most traveling was done by train and he’d send his children out across
  southern Minnesota by train. In each town, they’d pick up old rags and stuff and
  bring them back. Old newspapers and that sort of thing. And he’d process them and
  sell them out of Winona. Well, gradually, they got to processing these rags in those
  days there was a great deal of industrial machinery that needed what they call “wipe
  rags.” They’d launder these rags and cut them into certain lengths. Sometimes they’d
  dye them and then they’d sell them to railroads or people who use large machinery.
  They’d wipe their hands, they’d wipe the machinery with it and they’d throw their
  rags away.\nAlso, they developed what was called a waste mill. At one time, there
  were—I could be wrong about this, this is a long time ago—what were called waste
  mills and there were some thirty-odd waste mills in the country and these waste
  mills would go to fabric plants, people who made shirts and things of that nature.
  On the floor would be little cotton fibers about an inch, two inches long and they’d
  be swept up every night in piles and they’d sack them up and these waste mills would
  buy these fibers. They’d process 67\n5:00\nthem and package them and what they were—the
  people who work on the railroad engines would grab a handful of these fibers and
  use them as wiping, too. And waste mills did this. There was such a demand for the
  product that if they didn’t get enough sweepings off the floors of the fabric plants,
  they’d make them out of these rags that they picked up across the country.\nAt any
  rate, one son of this Miller family came to the University of Minnesota. They were
  all brilliant. Incidentally, Steve Goldberg, who was a professor at the University
  of Minnesota Law School, was a grandson of this immigrant. At any rate, one son
  went to the University and he refused to work in the junk business and the rag business
  and he went to New York and became a millionaire in the financial markets in New
  York. One son dropped out of high school and he was a genius and he was always inventing
  stuff and getting patents and finding very talented people around the country and
  hiring them and paying them good money to come and work for him and he is still
  living and Rudy Miller lives up here in Edina. The third one was a very brilliant
  young man who went to the University of Minnesota and studied engineering. But when
  Old Man Miller got sick, he had to drop out of Engineering School at about the third
  year and he went back to Winona and he actually did most of the actual physical
  running of the Miller Waste Mill.\nWell, World War II came along and lots of things
  changed. There was still a great deal of demand for this product that the waste
  mill made. They used it in packing guns in the navy ships. They used packing or
  wadding.\nSY: Oh, the wadding. Yeah.\nGEK: They formed a half dozen satellite companies,
  all of which got their raw product from the waste mill and the waste mill made money.
  I said there were thirty some odd waste mills in the country at the beginning and
  in the end, two were left. One of them was the Millers’ in Winona. It was the biggest
  one in the country. So, Oscar, the one who’d gone to New York and made a lot of
  money, he came back and sued his brother for diversion of corporate opportunities
  and so we went back and we had to review 68\npatents and we had to review balance
  statements and contracts and everything going back from World War I up until 1970’s.
  Roger Brosnihan was one of the lawyers in the case and Mel Siegel. We tried that
  case and I held that in this particular instance, there was not a diversion of corporate
  opportunity under certain rules and it came up here and was affirmed.\nSY: Was this
  a jury trial?\nGEK: No, it was a court trial. One hundred and some findings of fact.
  Took me six weeks to draw the findings. It was a very interesting case. You could
  write one of these serial novels about this family and how this immigrant family
  came here with literally nothing and worked hard and sacrificed and they were a
  minority religion and language and yet, had done so well. And had been such philanthropists.
  They’ve given millions of dollars away to hospitals and educational institutions
  and things of that nature. It’s really a fascinating story.\nSY: Now, when you talk
  about the legal doctrine of diversion of corporate opportunities, who were you protecting
  in that case? Who was the law trying to protect?\nGEK: The law wasn’t trying to
  protect either party. If the insiders were, in fact, diverting corporate opportunities,
  the other stockholders had a legitimate compliant. On the other hand, if they weren’t,
  if it was not a corporate opportunity to begin with, then they had no right to come
  in and hook on and try to benefit from something that they never had a right to
  to begin with.\nSY: So your decision was to decide between two groups of people
  involved in a corporation who had a right to the profits?\nGEK: Yes. It involved
  millions of dollars.\nSY: As I also recall, at about that time, there was a very
  unusual case that came up before the Supreme Court in which a Special Supreme Court
  had to be constituted. I 69\nunderstand you were part of that special temporary
  Supreme Court. Could you tell us about that strange circumstance?\n10:00\nGEK: Well,
  the Wilder Corporation was a charitable corporation here in St. Paul and they financed
  various kinds of medical research and other research. They had an executive director
  who had hired a doctor Wild, who was an English physician, to come over here, and
  he was doing research on mammary cancer and he was really kind of a charlatan. But
  at any rate, he got in a fight with the director, during the course of which, some
  of the board of directors of the Wilder Corporation got involved. When the Wilder
  Foundation was founded back in the early days of this century, they provided that
  one of the trustees would be appointed by a Supreme Court of Minnesota. And the
  Supreme Court thereafter always did. James C. Otis of this Court was a trustee and
  indeed, during the course of this dispute between Wild and the executive director
  of the Wilder Foundation and others, Judge Otis had some conversations with the
  participants. It was disputed what was said and what it was about, but he had some
  conversation. Well, anyway, it got into litigation and Judge Otis felt that he should
  disqualify himself and he did so, after which Malcolm Williams and J. Remington
  Graham, who represented Dr. Wild, suggested that the entire Supreme Court might
  well disqualify itself.\nSY: On what grounds did they seek that?\nGEK: Because they
  worked every day and were associated with Judge Otis and in order for them to make
  a decision in favor of Dr. Wild, they’d have to call Judge Otis a liar due to the
  conflict in evidence between the two and the appearance of impropriety and that
  sort of thing. Anyway, then Chief Justice Sharon decided to constitute a temporary
  Supreme Court consisting of the then-Chief Judges of the various district courts
  in the state and I happened to be Chief Judge of the Third Judicial District and
  that’s why I got on that court. We met a half a dozen times and eventually decided
  that case. As I recall, it was six to three in favor of the Wilder Corporation and
  sent it back for retrial. 70\nSY: Was the authority to constitute a temporary Supreme
  Court given by the state Constitution, the legislature, or inherent in the powers
  of the Chief Justice?\nGEK: That was one of the issues in the case, because it hadn’t
  been decided. Now, it’s in the statutes. But then it wasn’t. That was one of the
  contentions of Dr. Wild—that the Supreme Court had improperly used the state court
  administrator to change the law, allowing it to appoint a replacement court for
  this particular case. That was one of the contentions we had to address.\nSY: When
  did you first learn that you would be appointed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota?\nGEK:
  I can’t remember the exact date. It was some night in November of 1981. I knew there
  was a vacancy and I had applied for it. I got a call from the Governor.\nSY: This
  would have been Governor Quie at this point?\nGEK: Yes. It was a rainy, sleety night
  and the Governor said he was going to appoint me Associate Justice of the Supreme
  Court and I was to be at the capital at nine o’clock in the morning for a press
  conference. I was already in bed. So I jumped out of bed, put some clothes on, threw
  some in the car and started heading for the Twin Cities and it was icy and I was
  slipping all over the road. I got as far as Lake City and I decided I would not
  go any further and so I holed up in the motel there and I got up in the morning
  and I didn’t have any money to pay for the room. [Laughs]\nSY: Did they take your
  credit at that point?\nGEK: Well, I was able to assure them that they’d be paid
  and they let me go on. I stopped and visited with one of my former law clerks in
  Hastings and was able to get him to get me fifty bucks so I could eat and get home.
  But at any rate, it was that night in November, 1981. 71\nSY: Sounds like you were
  pretty excited by the opportunity to serve.\nGEK: I was very much interested. I
  had been one of the finalists a year before when Justice Amdahl and Justice Simonett
  were chosen.\nSY: Now, when you say finalist, that indicates that Governor Quie
  had some sort of a selection process that he went through.\n15:00\nGEK: Yes, he
  did. He had a commission or board, part of whom he appointed, but part of whom were
  appointed by the bar and law schools and so forth who made recommendations to him
  and they made a recommendation of three or five people out of all the candidates
  and I understand that the year before I had been one of the finalists. But I thought
  I was getting a little old to get the appointment the second time around. So I was
  happy about it.\nSY: Did you have anything particular in mind that you wanted to
  achieve as a Justice, either a court administration or areas of the law you wanted
  to look at?\nGEK: Not really, no. I had no agenda.\nSY: Was the Court what you expected
  it to be once you were up here?\nGEK: In most respects, yes. I can’t think of anything
  important that was otherwise.\nSY: How does the Supreme Court as an appellate court
  differ from a trial court?\nGEK: Well, for one thing, in the trial court, the trial
  judge is “it.” What he or she says goes until it’s been reversed by a higher court.
  Up here, what a judge says doesn’t go very far. It has to get by at least, at that
  time, five members of the Court and now it’s four members of the Court for it to
  go. And so it’s more of a collegial process where you debate and try to convince
  others. One does that as a trial judge but does it with oneself rather than with
  others. 72\nSY: In the process here on the Supreme Court of trying to convince others,
  what are your most effective tools? Precedent, emotional arguments, knowing the
  prejudices of your colleagues, the briefs of the lawyers, anything else that might
  come to mind?\nGEK: I’m not so sure I could categorize anything as the most important.
  I think under appropriate circumstances, each of these might have some bearing upon
  it. This Court has traditionally been rather loathe to reverse precedent, particularly
  if it’s of rather recent vintage. If it’s within the last ten years or so, they
  are pretty leery about re-examining a principal that’s been decided recently. Even
  if there may have been a change of personnel in the Court that the current personnel
  would, had they been there seven years ago, decided differently.\nSY: Is a different
  temper required to be a justice of this Court than a trial judge?\nGEK: I’m not
  so sure it does. You have to be patient in either instance. There are disagreements
  between the justices, but we are very fortunate on our Court that we debate robustly
  in the conference room following argument, but when we close the conference door
  and we leave it, it’s all left in the conference room and that’s not true of a lot
  of Supreme Courts and a lot of appellate courts.\nSY: Again, that’s a mark of the
  personal character of the individuals more than the law itself. Do you find it difficult
  to dissent from your colleagues?\nGEK: Yes, I think one does. At least I do. I have
  considerable respect for my colleagues and you better be pretty sure of your position
  that you’re not being obtuse and obstreperous just for obstruction’s sake. I think
  it’s difficult.\n[Track 10]\n0:00\nSY: When you are asked to write an opinion for
  the Court or when you dissent and you are writing for yourself, who is your audience
  and what do you try to do with the text of the opinion? 73\nGEK: It depends on the
  opinion who your audience is. Since the advent of the Court of Appeals, we have
  what we call Rule 117, which defines the kinds of cases we accept for discretionary
  review. We do have some reviews that come here as a matter of right: first degree
  murder texts, court cases, workers’ compensation cases, election cases and so forth,
  but most of our civil and criminal cases come here from the Court of Appeals. At
  this level—the Supreme Court level— we don’t usually write for the parties. We are
  writing for the bar, the portion of the bar that is practicing criminal law, the
  law enforcement officials, the police, and so forth. The scope and limits of procedural
  laws, constitutional provisions and what have you are limiting what government can
  do with respect to interfering with the freedom of the individual citizens. So our
  audience there is to the law enforcement area, in particular. For example, in an
  employment case, there has been attack for the past few years upon the so-called
  employment at will doctrine when it will ignored and what will be the results of
  it and so forth. There we are writing to a large area of employers and employees.\nSY:
  When you write to a diffuse body, such as employers and employees and their lawyers,
  which is more important— the narrow decision in the opinion on that case or the
  more general language you use to explain your policies?\nGEK: Well, I don’t like
  to get into discussing particular cases, but one of the leading cases in Minnesota
  is one in which I wrote a dissent and it was Lewis against the Equitable Life Assurance
  Company. That case very expansively increased the rights of an at-will employee
  against the employer for wrongful discharge. It was not an interstitial change in
  the law; it was a major change in the law—several major changes in the law. Five
  years ago, in 1985, that case bounced around here and I wrote a dissent. As a matter
  of fact, the dissent was finally published. It was not the first dissent I’d written
  on the case—it was about the fifth dissent. Some of the arguments I’d raised in
  prior dissents had been incorporated in the original opinion. But my point is this:
  that case has been a guideline and the basis of an awful lot of employment law ever
  since. Now, my dissent hasn’t changed much, but it’s always there as demonstrating
  the other 74\nviewpoint with respect to certain kinds of damages. So, sometimes
  when you write a dissent, as Cardozo said, you are “speaking to the brooding spirit
  of the law.”\n5:00\nSY: Hoping that someone will pick up on it. Do you remember
  any particular kinds of opinions or opinion that was very easy for you to write?\nGEK:
  I don’t really, as I sit here. I haven’t thought about it.\nSY: Any that were very
  hard for you for some reason?\nGEK: Yes. The Lewis case was very hard. I was very
  uncertain and I was one against seven at that time, as I recall. When you are the
  only one there, you better be pretty careful that you ","transl":{},"fullrs":{},"find":"22470.pdf","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2019-05-06","dmmodified":"2019-05-06","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"22469","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"468271","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.45
