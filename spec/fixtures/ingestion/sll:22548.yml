  JH: All right. It’s February 19, 2019, and I’m at the Continuing Legal Education Center [Minnesota CLE Conference Center, 600 Nicollet Mall #370, Minneapolis, MN] in
  Minneapolis [Minneapolis, MN] to interview retired Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page [Alan Cedric Page (August 7, 1945-)] for the Minnesota Supreme Court Oral History Project. The project is sponsored by the Minnesota Supreme Court Historical Society and its Preservation Committee in cooperation with the Minnesota State Law Library [Minnesota State Law Library, 25 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, St Paul, MN]. My name is Jeff Holth. I’m a practicing attorney here in Minnesota and I clerked for Justice Page from 2012 to 2013 and I’ll be conducting the interview today.
  Thank you for coming today, Justice Page, and for agreeing to share your experiences and insights on your years on the court.
  AP: Well, thank you for inviting me and hopefully we can have a fun conversation.
  JH: Agreed. So let’s jump right in. I know you graduated from law school in around 1978 and served on the Supreme Court from ’93 [1993] to 2015, but I want to start by asking you about your earlier life before we talk about your years on the court.
  AP: Sure.
  JH: So I wonder if you could just start us off by talking a little bit about your family and where you grew up.
  AP: I was born in Canton, Ohio. I was the fourth of four children. My mother was a—worked as an attendant in a country club and my father, various jobs from operating juke boxes to running a bar—that sort of thing. As I say, I was the fourth of four children, two sisters and a brother. My childhood was a pretty happy one, pretty uneventful, not much exciting to talk about. We weren’t the wealthiest of families, but we weren’t the poorest either.
  3
  My parents, neither one had the opportunity to go to school beyond high school and they emphasized for me and my brother and my sisters, the importance of education and the importance of being good citizens. And in their own way, something that, I think, stuck with me, they talked about and emphasized the importance of seeking excellence. Now they didn’t say it that way, but I think that’s the bottom line of what they were talking about. They would always—and I can hear them now telling me, Whatever you do in life, do it as well as you can. You’re going to be a garbage collector, be the best garbage collector you can be. If you’re going to be a doctor, be the best doctor you can be. Not as good as the next doctor or garbage collector, but the best one you can be. And that’s something that they preached and, I think, has served me well over time.
  JH: I think I recall you talking about, you know, at a pretty young age, having some experiences or influences that sort of made you think you might want to be a lawyer someday. Can you talk about that a little bit?
  AP: I very early on, you know, when I was eight, nine, ten years old, people would ask me what I wanted to do when I grew up and I would say I wanted to be a lawyer. And, you know, what eight-year-old knows really what they want to do when they grow up? But, as I noted, I grew up in Canton, Ohio. It was a town built on heavy industry, primarily steel, and I had an uncle who spent forty years working in the steel mill. And I knew intuitively that that’s not something that I wanted to do. Nothing wrong with working in steel mills, but from my eight-
  00:05:00 year-old eyes, the work was dirty; it was hard; it was dangerous and repetitious. And
  somehow I knew that that didn’t fit me.
  I’d heard stories about lawyers, that, you know, from—not that I knew any lawyers, or had any lawyers in my family or my family really knew any lawyers, but the impression in the community I grew up was that lawyers didn’t work too hard; made lots of money; drove big, fancy cars; lived in big houses and went out and played golf every Wednesday afternoon. But for the eight-year-old mind balancing fancy cars and dangerous and dirty work—
  JH: Which do I choose?
  AP: Which do I choose? It becomes real simple. I also grew up watching Perry Mason [Perry Mason, CBS television from September 21, 1957, to May 22, 1966], and so I had a very rudimentary sense of what the law was about from that television show and finally, and something that influenced me greatly. You have to remember that I grew up—I was eight years old in 1954. At the time our country was grounded in state sponsored segregation and in 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown versus the Board of Education[of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483] and I can remember reading newspaper stories about it; hearing people talk about it; and again, not that I understood it fully, but it gave me a sense of the power that the law has. That if the courts, through the law, could essentially sound the death knell for state sponsored segregation, it had the power to change how people treat one another. And that’s something that I grew up [with] and had an interest in.
  As I got older, I was disabused of the idea that lawyers didn’t work hard (laughter) or that they necessarily made lots and lots of money, but I also developed the sense that the law was 4
  about solving problems and helping people and that’s also something that resonated with me. And so that was sort of my dream for the future. And never lost it, never lost it. And, again, you know, 1954 there was Brown. Along the way there were—there was Little Rock [Little Rock, AR]; there was Birmingham [Birmingham, AL]; there were full blown civil rights movements, an effort to change or address issues of race in ways that hadn’t been successful in the past. And, I’m sure that all had some bearing on my sense of what the law was about and what could be done with the law.
  JH: You know, thinking about Brown v. Board, specifically, do you, I mean, what was Canton like growing up sort of in terms of a racial makeup? Was it a pretty segregated, in fact, city?
  AP: Absolutely. Absolutely. You knew where you belonged and didn’t belong and it’s interesting. I didn’t grow up in an area where the segregation was state sponsored, but in practical effect, it might as well have been.
  00:10:00 JH: So let’s talk briefly about Central Catholic High School, your high school experience
  in Canton. Was it the plan for you to attend Central Catholic because your family did or was it football related, or what was the trajectory there?
  AP: Well, our family moved from Canton out into the countryside with an East Canton, Ohio, address because my parents felt that the education available in the Canton city schools wasn’t what they wanted for us. And my two older sisters, interestingly, didn’t decide to go to school in East Canton. They, and along with my parents, concluded that Canton Central Catholic had the best possible education for our circumstances. And so they ended up going to Central Catholic. And then, my brother, who was ahead of me, he went and so, I was destined to follow.
  And I—before I got to high school, I hadn’t really—I wasn’t much of an athlete as a kid; I wasn’t one of those kids that everybody sort of sought after to come and be on their team, but my brother went out for football and so when I got there, I went out and it, as it turns out, I evidently had some aptitude for it.
  JH: I’ve heard you use that phrase, “Have some aptitude for it,” before, yeah. So what do you, in terms of high school, do you remember having an early interest in sort of the law and politics and those sort of things or were you still sort of navigating and not quite sure—?
  AP: I think I was always interested in politics from very early on. But only in the sense of trying to figure out how it works to help people. I never had much interest in politics for politics’ sake. And so when I got to high school, I mean, I—the courses I loved were, you know, back then it was civics and government—those kind of classes.
  JH: So was there a point—so you played football at Central Catholic and is there a point, even in high school, where you think that football could be used as a way to pursue an education or does that realization not happen until a little bit later or—?
  5
  AP: You know, growing up in Canton, there was this conflict between athletics and academics. There was a very strong emphasis on athletics, particularly in the African-American community and so I’m growing up not much interested in football and seeing an inordinate number of young men who had—I guess what you would call stellar high school football careers—go off to college for two, three, four years, come back to Canton, ended up hanging out on the street corner, unemployed and unemployable. And, you know, that didn’t make sense to me. I couldn’t figure out—this was before I started playing football. Then I started playing, as I said, more by accident than by design and I loved playing but I was just playing football because I loved it and not for any other purpose.
  00:15:00 By the time I was a, you know, sophomore/junior, there was talk that I might be able to obtain
  an athletic scholarship and so I suppose around that time I started thinking about [how] it could be used. One of the, in hindsight, one of the disappointments when I look back is that while I did okay as a student in high school; did okay as a student in elementary and junior high school; I did it the easy way. I didn’t, essentially I wasn’t there to learn how to learn. I was there to do the work and I could do the work without learning how to learn. I could, you know, answer the questions and work through the math problems and all of that but simply because you can do the work, doesn’t mean that you’re really learning a whole lot because, I think, the important part of what goes on in schools in the education process is learning how to learn and so I sort of missed that.
  And so as, in high school, the work got more difficult, I still, you know, thrived to some degree, but had I learned how to learn early on, I think, I mean, I was focused on going to school beyond high school because that was the emphasis my parents placed, but if I had sort of made that connection to learning how to learn early on, I might have had a little more success academically and not, I don’t focus on that so much because, you know, I could have been—done better in school—but I would have been better prepared for the future.
  As it turned out, I did okay, and ended up receiving a number of scholarship offers, athletic scholarship offers. I think had I had that—had I learned how to learn—there might have been some academic scholarships in that queue also, which gives you choices, right?
  JH: Sure.
  AP: But I had the opportunity to choose among some pretty good schools and ultimately selected the University of Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN].
  JH: That’s a good transition to Notre Dame and talk a little bit about your time in college. Why Notre Dame?
  AP: Primarily because of its academic reputation and because of its reputation in terms of how it interacted with its alumni. They have an incredible, had then, and continue to have, an incredible alumni association which provides any number of benefits to people who graduate
  00:20:00 from there in terms of employment opportunities and other kinds of support. And, you know,
  as I say, the schools that I was choosing from, they were all good schools. I mean, it was Purdue [Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN]; it was Michigan State 6
  [Michigan State University, 220 Trowbridge Road, East Lansing, MI]; it was Michigan [University of Michigan, 500 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI]; Minnesota [University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN]; Ohio State [Ohio State University, Columbus, OH]. So it wasn’t like they didn’t have some of the things that Notre Dame had to offer. But it was sort of looking beyond the college years that was, I think, ultimately the deciding factor.
  That, coupled with, I had no interest in going to Ohio State, who knows why? And Notre Dame also had this reputation, football wise, that, at least at the time, was about as good as it got, you know, to a black kid from Canton, Ohio, going to play in the house that Knute Rockne [Knute Kenneth Rockne (March 4, 1888–March 31, 1931)] built, that sort of put stars in your eyes for sure.
  JH: So was that an exciting time I would suspect in a lot of ways? Was it a nerve wracking time transitioning from Canton and leaving home, or—?
  AP: It was an exciting time; a very difficult time. I, you know, just going back to Central Catholic, I was one of two, I think, maybe three; maybe four; African-American kids in my graduating class. Going off to Notre Dame it was going to be, you know, there were a few more, but not many more so—and it was at a time that sort of our national economy was sort of in a downward spiral and Notre Dame is in South Bend, Indiana, and they were also a heavy industry town and one of the main employers there was Studebaker, the auto manufacturer, and they went out of business just about the time I got there. It was my first time away from home really. I’d not been a kid who’d gone off to camp and spent any time away from home so it was all new to me. And it was also, you know, the first time that I’d really been put in a position where I was responsible for myself as every kid who goes off to school is.
  JH: Sure, that’s a big change.
  AP: A huge change. And so it was difficult. And one of the things I didn’t realize was Notre Dame was not the most progressive place to go to school and so that was something that was a little different for me and having to adjust to that. There were some difficult transitions.
  JH: Speaking to kind of the economy, in a downturn, thinking about that time, too, and in a lot of ways the civil rights movement is sort of at its apex and the Voting Rights Act and so was that a part of the campus conversation or do you recall anything about that?
  00:25:00 AP: Not much, a little bit, but not much. You know, and being on the football team there,
  you really weren’t necessarily that much a part of the campus conversation, even though we were—we lived in the dorms with everybody else and went to meals with everybody else and went to classes with everybody else, your focal point was football and so you weren’t really much connected.
  And it was really kind of an interesting time in that respect because, I mean, the civil rights movement was going through some challenging times. About the same time, the Vietnam War protests started and so it’s sort of like you’re in this bubble looking out on all of this and not 7
  having a direct connection to it but having the opportunity to at least see it and think about it but not engage.
  JH: Well, it’s interesting you mention that because yeah, in thinking about it, the focus on football and you’re a young kid still and transitioning so maybe not a lot of capacity for a lot of other stuff when that’s the focus in a lot of ways.
  AP: Even if you had the instinct, they took up your time and your energy, both physical and emotional. And so it was, in that respect, I missed out on a lot but, you know, I can’t remember the precise timing, but my freshman year, the start of my freshman year, went to football training camp a couple of weeks before school started and I think we got there either just before or just after the March on Washington [The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 1963]. I think school had started by the time the bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church [The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. September 15, 1963), Birmingham, AL] had occurred in Birmingham. And so you had all of these things going on. As I noted, you’re sort of watching from afar. And understanding that they affect you, but sort of not directly.
  JH: Removed a little bit or, yeah. Well, the focus on football bore some fruit. National championship—was it your senior year?
  AP: Yes. I should note, I think it was in the—I think it was still while I was there or he was planning to come, one of our speakers, one of the people who was coming to campus to speak was George Wallace [George Corley Wallace Jr. (August 25, 1919–September 13, 1998)]. That got people engaged.
  JH: That got some attention?
  AP: That got some attention.
  JH: Did he come? Do you remember?
  AP: I’m pretty sure it was while I was still there. Needless to say, I didn’t attend.
  JH: Yeah, probably not a regret.
  AP: No.
  JH: So, you’re drafted by the Vikings kind of at the close of your career at Notre Dame and kind of moving ahead a little bit, there’s obviously lots to talk about that we could talk
  00:30:00 about with respect to your professional career in the NFL and—
  AP: It happened.
  JH: It happened. It happened. You’ve talked about it a little bit, right? But I want to focus on just kind of one unique aspect that I was interested about was your participation in the NFL 8
  Players Association. It’s something that I, you know, I’ve—I know you’ve talked about it before but we don’t hear that quite as often so I was just curious. You’re playing with the Vikings. How do you get involved in the Players Association and what’s sort of your role?
  AP: Well, there had been—this is a long, complicated story, too long and too complicated for here.
  JH: It’s a big question.
  AP: There had been various efforts on the part of players to organize before 1968. Nineteen sixty the league is confronted with another football league, the American Football League. In 1966, those two leagues merge with the merger taking place in ’68 and in 1968, the players from both leagues come together and form the National Football League Players Association. That was my second year in the league and somehow I either volunteered or agreed to serve as player representative. So that’s how I got involved.
  And, growing up in Canton, I was used to organized labor and had sort of a sense of what it was about and the other piece of it was that the reason players wanted to come together to form a union was because—well, there are a whole host of them, not the least of which is players essentially had no rights in terms of where they could play; very little ability to impact how much they were paid and then there were all these what I will call silly little rules that were imposed, I suppose, as a matter of control. That’s all I can think of. Things like you can’t have a beard or a mustache. I guess you could have a mustache but you couldn’t have a beard. Things like, you know, you have to be at every meal whether you want to eat or not. You have to—you can’t have a telephone in your room and this was before, you know, mobile phones, but you couldn’t have the telephone company put a phone in your room during training camp. I mean, those are just a couple that come to mind.
  And so there were really lots of limitations on a player’s ability to be themselves and players wanted to change that and obviously, the ability to choose where you worked would have an
  00:35:00 impact on how much you were paid. And so, I think for me, at least in the beginning, it was
  sort of all those little controls that just drove me crazy, that got me involved. And, you know, once you—you can’t get just a little bit wet once you’re into the pool you get all wet.
  JH: Did you enjoy it?
  AP: I loved it. It was frustrating at times but I think we laid the groundwork for the freedom that players have today. We laid the groundwork for players getting a fair share of the revenue. We laid the groundwork that allowed players to be treated like human beings as opposed to, in some sense, property. And along the way, I got to meet, know and work with a bunch of great lawyers. Leonard Lindquist [Leonard Lindquist (September 5, 1912-September 10, 2004)]; Gene Keating [Eugene Henry Keating (January 2, 1932-April 6, 2005)]; Ed Glennon [Edward M. Glennon (1924-April 24, 2009)]; Ed Garvey [Edward R. Garvey (April 18, 1940–February 22, 2017)]. I got to see from the inside what the law was all about and what good lawyering looks like.
  9
  JH: So is it fair to say that that was an influence on the decision to pursue a career?
  AP: That just confirmed—
  JH: That it was something you wanted to do.
  AP: That it was something I wanted to do. I enrolled at William Mitchell [now Mitchell Hamline School of Law, 875 Summit Avenue, St. Paul, MN] in the fall of 1968. I started my second year the league and it was not pretty.
  JH: Why not?
  AP: Well, you know, you get that assignment over the summer and there are like five hundred pages to read and you try to read it and none of it makes sense and you show up the first day and I don’t remember what the class was, but the professor could just as well be talking Greek as English. And, you think, I don’t understand what’s happening here because it’s a different process; at least it was a different process from what my undergraduate degree was like. And I was not ready for it.
  JH: Was it—well, you said you were second year in the league, playing and so was it—I mean, I’d suspect that obviously that has—playing is a lot of—the time commitment in and of itself so was it that you weren’t quite ready? Not enough time? Or did it—?
  AP: It wasn’t that. It was being confronted with being in this class and listening to these lectures that had no context.
  JH: Right.
  AP: And therefore made no sense. And, you know, it’s early on in the process so you don’t know how it all fits together.
  JH: New language.
  AP: New language, all of it. And I just—it was not pretty. (laughter)
  JH: Well, but it must not have—but it didn’t dissuade you, obviously, completely.
  AP: I say only half in jest, I knew after three days that I wasn’t going to survive, but I was in so far over my head that it took me another three and a half, three weeks to figure out how to drop out, to get out. And I—what I came to understand was, first of all, that I wasn’t alone.
  00:40:00 I mean, I’m sitting there thinking, I’m the only one that doesn’t get this. I’m the only one that
  doesn’t understand this. But, you know, everybody in the room was in the same boat that I was. Had I—maybe had I not been playing football at the time, I’d have sort of stuck it out, but I mean, I was so far in over my head, I mean, I just couldn’t see—
  10
  JH: The path.
  AP: The path.
  JH: Yep, overwhelming.
  AP: And so, I bailed. But didn’t necessarily give up the hope or the idea. Over the years I tried one or two other career options. I was a used car salesman or actually a new/used car salesman. I sold one car during my auto sales experience.
  JH: I did not know that, that you tried that.
  AP: And the one car I sold to myself. (laughter) So I figured there was no career in that. I had a vending machine company for about a year and half. It took me—I invested about forty thousand dollars into it and it took me about a year and a half to go through that, although that was one of the—actually not one of—the best investment I ever made and we’ll get to that later, but one of the things I was learning was business, being in business, was not something that fit me; not something that interested me; not something that I wanted to put the time and energy and effort into becoming good at, which was a good lesson to learn. And ultimately, after my eighth year with the Vikings, I decided to go back to law school; this time having a better understanding, having been involved in, as a players’ rep, and then ultimately on the executive committee of the Players Association; been involved in a number of lawsuits involving the Players Association and the National Football League.
  Still, having the opportunity to see even more deeply how lawyers work, the way they thought, developing a sense for that and having the opportunity to talk with them and sort of learn that law school is just like that and that the secret to it is to endure. And at some point it starts to make sense. So after my eighth year I decided to go back. This time enrolled at the University of Minnesota and actually started the summer of 1975 at the University of Texas in Austin [Austin, TX]. I took contracts and procedures, thirteen weeks start to finish.
  JH: Wow!
  AP: And survived it.
  JH: There you go.
  AP: Not only survived it; loved every minute of it.
  JH: Confidence booster?
  AP: Big confidence booster.
  JH: Absolutely.
  11
  AP: Big confidence booster. Learned, you know, a little bit of the process of, remember how I talked about having failed to learn how to learn?
  JH: Exactly.
  AP: Took me to law school to get it.
  JH: Sometimes I wonder if it takes a lot of people up until that point. In some ways, I sort
  00:45:00 of felt the same way.
  AP: Well, but once I got it—
  JH: Yeah.
  AP: there’s nothing else like it.
  JH: Right.
  AP: And so I loved the law school experience. People, you know, are always talking about, Well, you went to law school and played professional football—how hard that must have been. Yeah, things are hard but when you’re having fun, there’s nothing better. I mean, I loved my law school experience at the university.
  And I had another one of those defining moments and I think it was towards the end of my first year. We had a paper to write and I decided I was going to, you know, take the easy road, something you know about, labor, labor law. And actually I think I wrote something on labor relations in the NFL. But I, you know, I spent all this time doing the research and preparing and I just—nothing happened. And I can remember going in to see one of the associate or assistant deans and saying, I don’t know that I can do this. And he said, Well, you can do it. All you have to do is apply yourself. And I think, What have I been doing?
  JH: Well, that clears it up, right?
  AP: Right. And he said, No, you apply the seat of your pants to the chair until you get it, until it starts coming and, you know, it’s weird but, you know, I sat down, got my books and my pens and my papers and sat there and eventually started writing and got it done. And that was an important lesson—that sometimes even when you know what you want to do, but it’s not coming together, you have to just keep working at it until it happens.
  JH: This is jumping ahead a little bit so we’ll have to swing back but that makes me think about the process of sitting down and writing an opinion a little bit, too. Is there a similarity there, too? The process of just needing to sit down and sort of delve in to get it started and once it’s started, flows a little bit?
  AP: It flows. Absolutely.
  12
  JH: Interesting. So law school at U of M. I was going to ask you and I think you really answered it was, you know, by the time you do go to the U of M, you’re still playing; raising a family; not like there aren’t any other things going on. You’re busy but you manage it by—
  AP: But then it’s just a matter of time management.
  JH: Sure.
  AP: And figuring out how to, you know, make it all work, putting all the pieces together. And I mean, I did have some incentive. I mean, by then I was twelve years into my professional career. You don’t play forever and quite frankly, I didn’t want to necessarily play forever. As I’ve said often, by the time I started law school, I’d been playing for—I was into my ninth year and I hadn’t done everything you could do on a football field but I’d done most of them and I noted earlier, repetition wasn’t one of my strong suits. It was time to prepare to do something different so that I could move on. As I’ve often said, you know, the skills of a defensive tackle don’t transfer to much of anything else out in the real world and so preparing
  00:50:00 to do something beyond football was really important. And law school was that preparation.
  JH: Right. So you graduate from law school and you graduate and —you graduate and—what’s the timing there? You still play for a little bit after you graduate?
  AP: I played three and a half more years.
  JH: Three and a half more years and so you’re—
  AP: Seventy-eight; seventy-nine [1979]. Four more years.
  JH: Okay. During that time, then, you graduate, you’re playing, but then you start at Lindquist and Vennum [Lindquist & Vennum, offices in Minnesota, Colorado, and South Dakota; formed in 1968 when Lindquist, Magnuson & Glennon combined with Vennum, Newhall, Ackman & Goetz. As of January 1, 2018, the firm merged with and took the name of Ballard Spahr]. So what’s the practice there like? Tell me about that a little bit.
  AP: It’s trying to figure out who you are as a lawyer. And it’s, you know, getting assignments and, you know, Here’s the file. Go do this. And it’s like, How do you go do this? (laughter)
  JH: A little more explanation.
  AP: Would be helpful. It wasn’t always forthcoming. Sort of get thrown into the thick of things and there were some horrible, awful, very bad moments where I had no idea what I was doing but had to try to figure it out while I was doing it.
  JH: Enjoyable though?
  AP: Not especially. 13
  JH: No?
  AP: One of the things I figured out early on about the private practice of law, it’s about business; it’s about billing hours and that just—it never—that is not me. My interest in the law was the law and trying to sort of work through it, sort it out and figure it out and come to the best conclusions that you can. And when you’ve got this little thing sitting on your shoulder talking about billable hours, first of all, you’re distracted by that because you’re thinking, Hey, am I billing enough hours and how do I justify these hours? And so from that standpoint, it was not necessarily pleasant.
  That said, I got to work with some really good lawyers and like every other new lawyer, Can you do a memo for me on this? And you give them the memo and it comes back and it’s like, I didn’t know there was that much red ink in the world. (laughter)
  JH: But lessons, then, as well, I suppose, too, right, so you’re—
  AP: Absolutely.
  JH: it’s a big learning curve but you’re learning a lot.
  AP: But you’re learning a lot. That’s where I got grounded and so from that standpoint, it was a very valuable experience but just not my idea of a good time. And I was fortunate enough to make my way to the attorney general’s office and I loved it there because Skip Humphrey [Hubert Horatio "Skip" Humphrey III (June 26, 1942-)] was the attorney general and he let the lawyers who were there to do the work, do the work. And let me learn to give my best legal advice to my clients. Didn’t have to worry about billing hours; didn’t have to worry about clients walking away. I could do the best that I could to figure out what is the best—what is the law and what is the best advice I can give this client? And I could do that and there’s a lot of freedom in that and I absolutely loved it.
  00:55:00 JH: Did you have a particular focus in the attorney general’s office?
  AP: Labor and employment.
  JH: You were? Okay.
  AP: Labor and employment.
  JH: And you enjoyed that?
  AP: And that’s what I did at Lindquist also on the employee side and just flipped to the employer side.
  JH: So you’re working at the Minnesota Attorney General’s office four years, five years-ish, something like that? 14
  AP: Started in ’85, the first week of January, 1985, and left the last week of December in 1992.
  JH: Okay, so, yeah. So when do you start thinking about—maybe not even necessarily the Minnesota Supreme Court but the idea of doing something different and maybe that being judging?
  AP: You know, I had this weird experience. In 1982, I’m at Lindquist and Vennum and—’82 or ’83—and I wake up one morning and the newspaper has an article about Governor Perpich [Rudolph George Perpich Sr. (June 27, 1928–September 21, 1995)] is going to appoint some new judges and he’s got my name on the list. Nobody had asked.
  JH: Interesting.
  AP: It was very strange but up until that point it hadn’t really occurred to me a) that I would have the interest in being a judge or that I could be, or that I had the skills or temperament. Long story short, made me think about it. And, you know, through that time, I’m learning who I am as a lawyer; what my skills are; what my interests are; and what my strengths and weaknesses are. And over time, I sort of start thinking, Maybe there is something in the judiciary that would fit me, but I can’t see myself necessarily as a trial court judge. And, you know, as lawyers we spend a lot of time reading opinions and struggling to figure out what they mean. And thinking, Well, if they meant this, why didn’t they just say it? Why is it so hard to say in plain clear language what you mean?
  And of course, my ego says to myself, Self, you could do that. You could write clearly. You could write concisely and so over time I start to think my skills and my interests, my abilities, my strengths lend themselves to what appellate court judges do. And from there, well, how does one become an appellate court judge? Well, as you know in Minnesota, it’s either by appointment or by election. And the Minnesota Court of Appeals is new, relatively new, and most of the judges there or many of the judges there had been trial court judges, so that seems like a natural step even though the trial court isn’t necessarily what fits me. And so I started applying for trial court judge positions and had absolutely no success.
  01:00:00 Eventually I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t going to have any success and that, if I
  wanted the opportunity to serve, it was probably going to be through election, which narrows things down to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
  JH: Right.
  AP: And my thought process was, Well, if you’re going to seek election, you might as well seek election to the Minnesota Supreme Court. I think I have something to contribute. I think, both from a legal background, but also from just a different perspective, and so, 1990, I decided to seek election. And when the filing period opened, I was down there first morning, first hour, filed for election and the justice who I was going to challenge; thought I was going to challenge, resigned before I got out of the secretary of state’s office. 15
  JH: Oh wow.
  AP: Which created a vacancy. Vacancies are filled by appointment. The governor immediately appointed someone to fill the vacancy and the election for that seat no longer existed. And I, in seeking election, it wasn’t about the individual justice who I was going to challenge; it wasn’t about their opinions or their philosophy or their anything else; it was simply—it seemed to me to be a fair question given that the justice was going to reach mandatory retirement within something less than six months of re-election and it was a fair question, at least I thought, to have the people of Minnesota decide who they would want to serve the term.
  Me, a known quantity, a known person, or some unknown, ultimately some unknown person. The election was taken off the ballot and, you know, it wasn’t clear to me why, you know. Being a person of color, one of the things that comes to mind is, Is it because I’m a person of color? Is it politics? Is it—I don’t know—let that go; continued working at the attorney general’s office and decided to try again in 1992.
  This time, the justice I sought to challenge, was going to reach mandatory retirement within about eighteen months of the full six-year term and I thought again it was fair question to have the people of Minnesota decide who the justice should be who serves in that seat. Before I could get to the—before the filings opened, we had this provision in our constitution which provides for the retirement of the judges and there is a statute which provided, also provides to carry out that constitutional provision, which provided that the governor could extend
  01:05:00 the term of a justice who hadn’t reached full retirement at the time they were up for re-
  election and with mandatory retirement approaching. And so Justice Yetka [Lawrence R. Yetka (October 1, 1924–November 12, 2017)] who was the justice who I was going to challenge, sought a term extension; the governor granted it and I was, to say the least, more than a little frustrated.
  And so, long story short, I commenced a lawsuit against the governor and the secretary of state, a lawsuit that had its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court and a number of people told me I was crazy, that you’re wrong on the law; you’re wrong on the politics and you’re never, you know, when you lose this lawsuit, you’re never, ever going to have the opportunity to serve.
  I felt strongly about one, that the, as applied, the term extension violated the constitution. I wasn’t much concerned about the politics because I’d been—sort of along the way I’d figured out you have to do what you think is right, not what is expedient, and turns out I was right on the law; we were right on the law. And I was given the opportunity, along with anybody else who wanted to file for election for the seat. I filed; Justice Yetka did not and two other people did and almost immediately, not almost immediately, immediately, my opponents started down the road of, He's just a football player. And initially, implicit, but unstated, he’s just a dumb football player. Also initially, but not necessarily subsequently, but initially, he’s just a dumb, black football player. I mean, that was the tenor of what was being said. He’s not qualified. 16
  I spent the next three months, three and a half months, whatever it is, campaigning around the state to talk about why I wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. What I could bring what I had to offer about my experience and my background and my qualifications. And at every turn, I got the accusatory question, What are your qualifications? And nobody else was being asked that. And so that was difficult. That said, it was also satisfying to be able to talk to people about who I am and what I thought I had to offer and in the end, the people of this state gave
  01:10:00 me the opportunity to serve. They elected me. I am humbled, honored. I have a hard time
  articulating how meaningful it is to me that they saw through the effort to stereotype me; that they saw in me somebody who hopefully, had something to contribute and they gave me the opportunity to do it.
  JH: Was—so, you know, you mentioned that, in terms of the campaign, questions about qualification, but implicit questions about—
  AP: Race.
  JH: what it means to be an athlete—race. Was diversity, and the fact that, if elected, you’d be the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice: Was that a part of that conversation explicitly or was that not really a part of that discussion?
  AP: That wasn’t a part of the discussion.
  JH: So you’re elected.
  AP: And I show up the first day.
  JH: What’s the first day like?
  AP: Well, I had a month before, I’d been given briefs for the—
  JH: Get to work.
  AP: Yes, for the argument calendar in January of ’93, and initially I had been assigned a case that was being heard that first day.
  JH: Okay.
  AP: Mind you, I had—I didn’t know how the system worked, right?
  JH: Right. The norms, the processes—
  AP: The norms, the processes, any of it. And so I’m fast tracking, trying to figure all this out and it turns out the case that they gave me, I had a conflict. Phew! So they switched cases and gave me one for the second day. I was getting my baptism by fire. I, you know, read the briefs, prepared—didn’t know what—and for my case the second day, as you know, we do a 17
  report to the court, I’d never done a report to the court because I hadn’t been on the court. But I had to sort of figure that out but I had no sort of context for doing that. And the—I was sworn in before the first argument the first day and we were having a public ceremony after it.
  JH: That very first day.
  AP: That very first day, public swearing in.
  JH: There were some distractions beyond the work of the court.
  AP: One or two. And sat through the one argument because I was recused on the other but sat through my first case conference and learned what a report was like. Do the public swearing in ceremony; celebrate with family, and at the end of the day, get that report written.
  JH: And that report on your mind kind of throughout the day a little bit?
  AP: Oh, absolutely.
  JH: Yeah, I got to get that report; I’ve got some work to do.
  AP: I’ve got some work to do. At least now I know what it is. And the second day I had
  01:15:00 my—we had the two cases I sat through, gave my report and that’s the way it begins. We
  don’t do that anymore. At least when I left the court, new justices had some time to learn the system.
  JH: So was that a, I mean, do you think back on the first—beyond the first day or two, the first week; the first month, as I said, because it was trial by fire a little bit right away that it was an easy transition? I mean, hard by the way, but a quick one or—?
  AP: Invigorating, and a very quick transition. You know, as with anything new, particularly in the world of work, you don’t know the rules and the norms until you violate them and so you’re trying to figure it all out and, you know, you have your missteps along the way but you figure it out and, as with many things, the question isn’t whether you made the mistake, but what did you learn from it. In this particular instance, I had to be a quick learner and I was.
  JH: Absolutely.
  AP: And then, you know, you get that first case behind you, the argument and the report, and then you’ve got to write—
  JH: You’ve got some more work to do. It’s not over.
  AP: And having never written an opinion before, you have to learn how to do that.
  JH: Which is a whole other beast in and of itself. 18
  AP: Absolutely, but I had a good law clerk, Ian Nemiroff, who helped me a lot. He helped me a lot. And as over the years, I had a bunch of great clerks who made me look good time and time again.
  JH: I wanted to ask about clerks, not in a selfish way, but it’s definitely a part of your work on the court, daily work on the court. What did you look for in a clerk?
  AP: I looked for people who were curious; people who had something in their background that was out of the norm. Justice Gardebring [Sandra Gardebring Ogren (June 14, 1947–July 20, 2010)] used to refer to what she called Standard Issue Law Students, SILS (laughter). I didn’t want Standard Issue Law clerks. I wanted people who—obviously you want somebody that can write; you want somebody that’s going to work hard. But you want somebody who’s going to have good judgment and a sense of curiosity to sort of look under the rocks that need to be looked under and not under the ones that don’t and who can figure that out pretty quickly. And who are willing to or who were willing to tell me when I was wrong. I didn’t need a law clerk or law clerks who would tell me what I want to hear. I don’t like surprises and so, when I’m working with a clerk, I want the clerk to make sure there are no surprises.
  JH: Right.
  AP: And I was pretty lucky along the way—a bunch of great writers, yourself included; hard workers; curiosity—you fit the bill nicely.
  JH: Well, it’s—I always talk about, too. It’s one of those incredible experiences where you get out of law school and then the work, in many ways, it feels like some of the most
  01:20:00 important work that you’ll do as an attorney, working on the court so pretty incredible
  experience.
  So talk about—I recall in the year in your office—
  AP: I should also note, I wanted diversity in my clerks. I wanted women; I wanted clerks who were people of color; I wanted diversity in their, you know, where they came from; what their experiences were—because all of that makes; all of that enriches the process and makes what I do as a judge better having different views, different ways of looking at things and I mean, I think that’s vital.
  JH: Your approach to tackling an opinion. I remember you taking, I think, a lot of joy in peeling apart the layers, finding the resolution, and obviously, as you’ve said many times before, none of the cases that come before the Minnesota Supreme Court are simple. They’re there because they’re complex. Talk about that a little bit.
  AP: They’re there because they’re complex; they’re there because they’re important to the people involved in them, no matter who they are, whether it’s a—the fifth petition for review from a post-conviction inmate, or, you know, some large corporation, it’s important to the people that we serve. It’s important to the people of the state that we do it well and that we do 19
  it as right as we can. And I—opinion writing is—on any given day I will tell you it’s more art than science or that it’s more science than art.
  JH: Right.
  AP: It’s really a combination of both and for me, it was very important to work with the word so that what the opinion said was clear, easily understood, easily read and helpful. And to do that for me, it was about making sure that there were no unintended words, much less unintended ideas but no unintended words that—every word was thought about; that every word was where it was in the sentence because that’s the best use of the word in communicating the idea that you’re trying to communicate. That every sentence in the paragraph was where it was because that was the best way to communicate what you were trying to communicate in the paragraph. That every paragraph in the opinion was where it was because that’s where it was most helpful.
  01:25:00 I suspect that you clerks probably thought I was a little obsessive and maybe even a little
  compulsive but certainly obsessive about words, how we used the language, but that was important to me; that was very important to me.
  JH: I remember you talked right away about the purpose of every word. If it doesn’t have a role; if it’s not there for a reason,
  AP: Gone.
  JH: Get it out.
  AP: If it doesn’t have a reason, it’s not helping anybody. All it does is add length and the potential for confusion.
  JH: And the potential for interpretation differently than the intent was.
  AP: Different than what you intended.
  JH: Right, I remember that lesson. It sticks with me for sure. I was always struck with the collegiality and rapport on the court. You know, it was a serious place; a lot of important work, but I also remember, at least feeling like, the justices had a lot of respect for one another and were good friends as well. Can you speak to that a little bit?
  AP: Well, you know, it’s interesting. You have seven people, and changing all the time, who have big brains; who would like to think they’re the smartest one in the room; who have views that conflict and who feel strongly about their opinions. But we’ve been lucky here in Minnesota to have people understand that the institution is more important than any one of us and institutionally, it is important to maintain that collegiality, even when your colleagues, in your view, are so far wrong that you can’t understand how they could possibly be there. And sometimes the tension is pretty high but in the end you have to understand that a.) it’s about the institution and the work; it’s not about me. And also, you have to understand that, you 20
  know, some day you may need that colleague to get where you want to go in a particular case or where you think a case should go.
  When I first got on the court I would hear these stories about what was going on in other states with their Supreme Courts. Justices inviting one another out into the corridor to have a fight; justices showing up at conference and placing a handgun on the conference table. How does that work? How can you have a justice system that—or that the members of which of
  01:30:00 their courts are so antagonistic with one another that they can’t be civil even, you know, under
  pressure? How do you reach good decisions doing that? I don’t think you can. One of the things that was also, I think, important for our court during my time there, to ensure the understanding that collegiality was important and that it’s the institution, it’s not us, was that we, in our conference, you know, there are seven of us. We know each other by first name. We refer to each other as Justice So and So, just to make it clear in our own minds and everybody else in the room, that this is an institutional decision we’re making. This is the institution that is acting; it’s not me, Alan Page, making a decision. I’m making it on behalf of this institution. And it’s a way to sort of force you to treat people with respect and I think it served us well.
  JH: Those small things are not small things.
  AP: Not small at all.
  JH: Right.
  AP: Not small at all.
  JH: Right. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the first—the critical first of being the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice? Sort of looking back and thinking about the role of that first in your work on the court?
  AP: I have a hard time doing that because that wasn’t what it was about. Institutionally, I think it’s important that there had to be a first. Institutionally, it would have been better had it been somebody long before me. The fact that it finally happened—that we finally opened the door if you will for people of color, I think it was very significant. I think equally significant was the fact that when I joined the court, the court was a majority of women.
  JH: That’s right.
  AP: People would ask me, What’s it like serving on the court with a majority of women, right? And, of course, having not served on a court that wasn’t a majority of women, I thought, Well, that’s the natural order of things. But those things are important—that our judicial—that people who serve in our judicial system reflect the people of this state. I’ve said many times that the only power that courts have is founded in the trust and confidence of the people we serve and the less the members of the judiciary look like the people they serve, the less trust and confidence our judiciary will have. And so I think finally breaking that barrier was critically important. 21
  01:35:00 JH: Right. On that note, I mean, early on in your tenure as a justice—and I want to get this
  right—your service on the Minnesota Supreme Court Task Force on Racial Bias in the Judicial System. Report’s issued in 1993.
  AP: Six months after I joined the court.
  JH: Right. And you were involved.
  AP: Well, I—
  JH: Can you just describe that a little bit or what was your participation; what was your experience?
  AP: I became the chair of the committee that was going to implement the task force report. That was challenging for me. Remember my interest in the law was the law and not in being an administrator? And so from that standpoint, a lot of the things that, not only that committee, but we all—we had various committee assignments. I have to say those committee assignments were not my favorite part of being on the court.
  But this was an important one and, you know, we ended up working through the—depending on how you count them—the one hundred plus recommendations, pretty much most of them being implemented. But—and the implementation made things better but it didn’t solve the problem. It was a little—I think we made very incremental progress. But the disparities that came out of the report, particularly in the criminal justice area, where African-Americans, people of color are arrested more often; stopped more often; charged more often; given higher bail; less fair trials; higher conviction rates; longer sentences; all things being equal, that hasn’t ended and that’s just on the criminal justice side. There’s the juvenile justice and all the other aspects of the report.
  I’ve more or less come to the conclusion that before real change is going to happen, we have to take a more fundamental look at what our law is grounded in, which is to say, it’s grounded in a constitution that counted those imported as slaves as three-fifths of a person. And while we’ve had the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments ending slavery, ensuring due process and guaranteeing the right to vote, the law itself, the foundation, is still on cases that arose out of slavery and we’ve got to figure out how to tease that out of it before we have fundamental change.
  JH: Structural fundamental change, right?
  01:40:00 AP: It’s a structural, systemic problem.
  JH: What about, Justice Page, any notable opinions; dissents; anything come to mind? You wrote a lot so it’s a big body of work but—?
  22
  AP: I have never, in my own head, quantified or qualified whether it was a dissent or an opinion in terms of its importance. It seems to me that once you do that; once you decide that this one is more important than that one, you start doing both of them a disservice. And so I just took each one as they came and tried to put the same energy and effort into trying to get it right. And again, as I say, whether it was that fifth post-conviction petition, or, you know, some mega million dollar corporate issue, the people who come before us deserve to have our fullest attention and so I just don’t qualify them, quantify them in that way.
  JH: Don’t think of it as that, right? So, during your tenure on the court, one thing I wanted to ask you about, too, is just sort of the interplay, if you think of there being one at all, between your continued community engagement and still working on the court. You know, we would—I think back a lot on going and reading with you and other staff in the court, reading to elementary school kids on Wednesdays or whatever day it was. That community engagement and, you know, did that play a role in your work in your works as a justice? Did you see it sort of separately or was it related and did it inform your work?
  AP: Oh, I think everything we do -- our lives inform our work. I don’t know that I, you know, my reading with kids or my involvement to the extent that I had it, which was quite limited at the Page Education Foundation, influenced my work directly but it’s a part of who I am and being engaged in the community around us at some level helps us understand those people we are a part of but also who we represent. And I think it would be a mistake to be isolated and not a part of the world around us to the extent, obviously, to the extent possible, to the extent that it doesn’t create conflicts.
  JH: You’ve had some time now after retiring, I suppose to think back. Any, I guess maybe the question is, in thinking about it and this kind of gets to some final reflections about your time on the court, it’s a big question, but what is it—personally and professionally—can you put into words what the service meant to you?
  AP: Well, for me, it was the most, in terms of my professional life, the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. The challenges of working with seven other people. I mean, I looked forward to every day when I was on the court, particularly to those days where we would hear argument and have conferences because every conference you got stretched in ways that you would never get stretched and I loved that. Trying to understand what your colleagues are saying and thinking; trying to understand what you were thinking in the context of what they are saying and thinking and trying to understand what you were thinking.
  JH: Work through thought processes, right.
  AP: And working through all that doesn’t get any better.
  JH: Sometimes arriving at unexpected places, too?
  AP: Oh, all the time, all the time. Arriving at unexpected places; arriving at places that, on a personal level, you wouldn’t want to arrive at. You—if I could decide this on my own, this is not what I would do, but not my choice, you know. One of the—a little bit disconcerting 23
  things about our society—is I don’t think people understand how important it is for judges to be impartial and to exercise their judgment and not impose their will. And just the challenge of doing that all the time and trying to get that right, it’s all very much fun; very invigorating; very satisfying. And, hopefully, in the end, I did it as well as I could do it. I leave that up to others to decide but that was certainly my goal and I enjoyed every minute of it along the way.
  JH: What about the future of the court? You’re not on it, obviously, anymore, but thinking about challenges, hopes; any thoughts come to mind about the future?
  AP: My hope would be that they continue to be independent; that they continue to act impartially and understand that it is about the exercise of judgment and if the court’s members can do that it’ll have a bright future. And there’s something about, at least from my experience on the court looking back and looking forward, I think there’s a pretty good chance that things will continue in that regard as they have.
  The court’s leadership understands. I had the good fortune to serve with, let me think—I knew the number exactly at one time. Let’s see—one, two three—I can’t remember the exact number—six or seven or eight—
  01:50:00 JH: Chief justices?
  AP: chief justices and each one of them got it. They were all different but each one of them understood how important it is for our court to maintain its independence and its impartiality and to make decisions based on the law and the facts and their best judgment and not on the way the wind is blowing today. We’ve been lucky to have really good people, both at the chief justice, as chief justices, and as associate justices and I, to be included in that group is pretty special.
  JH: You know, I want to definitely, before we close out, give you an opportunity to speak to your late wife Diane’s [Diane Sims Page (1944-September 30, 2018)], role in your career.
  AP: Well, I mentioned earlier about that forty thousand dollars I lost on the vending machines?
  JH: Yeah, that’s right.
  AP: The company that owned the vending machines was a subsidiary of General Mills.
  JH: I know where this is going now.
  AP: And, long story short, I was in the lobby at General Mills one day, having left the meeting and left my car keys and everything else in the meeting and I’m sitting, waiting for somebody to bring them back to me and Diane walks into a meeting that she was going to there. I got introduced to her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Absolutely the best thing that ever happened to me. She is the love of my life; she kept me grounded at the same time lifting me up. She had this magic ability to lift people up, no matter who they 24
  were; no matter what the circumstances were. She had incredible insight into people and she is in large measure the key to much of the success that I’ve had. She was there every step of the way, allowing me, encouraging me, supporting me. And, as I say, I couldn’t have been luckier to have met her, fallen in love with her and spent the years that we had together. And she was one of those people who—I have ideas. She was a doer.
  JH: Executor.
  AP: Absolutely, and it wasn’t, you know, When are you going to get this done? It’s, Why wasn’t this done yesterday? Well, because we just found out that we had to do it today. She was in a sense, driven and driven to do good; driven to make this world a better place, that’s for sure. And I got lucky.
  01:55:00 JH: Well, you have retired from the court but you’re busy.
  AP: I am busy.
  JH: And so I’ve got to ask, what’s next? What’s next for Justice Page?
  AP: Well, there’s still plenty of work to do with the Page Education Foundation and beyond that, I’m trying to figure out what I’m going to do when I grow up. I haven’t sorted that out yet but I spend a lot of time in schools and classrooms still, talking to young children. As you know, I’ve had the good fortune to be able to write three children’s books with my youngest daughter and we’ve got to get on to book four.
  JH: I was going to ask; that was my next question.
  AP: We’ve got to get on to book four.
  JH: More work to be done.
  AP: More work to be done.
  JH: And Justice Page Middle School? I mean, it seems you spend time—I see pictures and things and you’re really engaged with the school.
  AP: I am engaged with the school. The school is magic. You know, sixth, seventh, eighth graders—they energize me still. They keep me going. And I also have four grandchildren that do the same thing.
  JH: Being a grandfather, a job in and of itself.
  AP: Yes.
  JH: Well, I think that’s a good place to close. Unless you have any other thoughts. We’ve had a good conversation so thanks for sharing your insights today. And thank you, I think in 25
  thinking about this conversation through the arc from beginning to end and the focus on the Minnesota Supreme Court, I want to and then I thank and we all want to thank you for your service on the Supreme Court, too.
  AP: Well, thank you for that, but I can’t articulate how much I loved serving on the court and being able to serve the people of this state. I can’t articulate how honored I am that the people of this state gave me the opportunity to do it and I don’t know—well, let me just back up. You know, one of the humbling things about serving is you’re there; you’re working on cases and you’re looking at cases from 1860, trying to figure out what the law is today because it’s grounded in something that took place back then. The idea that cases that I worked on when I was on the court will be used one hundred fifty, two hundred years from now, that the law will be grounded in something that I was a part of during my tenure, it’s almost overwhelming.
  JH: It’s an awesome thought.
  AP: I just hope that I didn’t goof it up so that hopefully what I did; what we did when I was on the court will make their jobs easier.
  JH: Sure. A good note to end on.

  Center, 600 Nicollet Mall #370, Minneapolis, MN] in\nMinneapolis [Minneapolis, MN]

  (August 7, 1945-)] for the Minnesota Supreme Court Oral History Project. The project
  is sponsored by the Minnesota Supreme Court Historical Society and its Preservation
  Committee in cooperation with the Minnesota State Law Library [Minnesota State Law
  Library, 25 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, St Paul, MN]. My name is
  Jeff Holth. I’m a practicing attorney here in Minnesota and I clerked for Justice
  Page from 2012 to 2013 and I’ll be conducting the interview today.\nThank you for
  coming today, Justice Page, and for agreeing to share your experiences and insights
  on your years on the court.\nAP: Well, thank you for inviting me and hopefully we
  can have a fun conversation.\nJH: Agreed. So let’s jump right in. I know you graduated
  from law school in around 1978 and served on the Supreme Court from ’93 [1993] to
  2015, but I want to start by asking you about your earlier life before we talk about
  your years on the court.\nAP: Sure.\nJH: So I wonder if you could just start us
  off by talking a little bit about your family and where you grew up.\nAP: I was
  born in Canton, Ohio. I was the fourth of four children. My mother was a—worked
  as an attendant in a country club and my father, various jobs from operating juke
  boxes to running a bar—that sort of thing. As I say, I was the fourth of four children,
  two sisters and a brother. My childhood was a pretty happy one, pretty uneventful,
  not much exciting to talk about. We weren’t the wealthiest of families, but we weren’t
  the poorest either.\n3\nMy parents, neither one had the opportunity to go to school
  beyond high school and they emphasized for me and my brother and my sisters, the
  importance of education and the importance of being good citizens. And in their
  own way, something that, I think, stuck with me, they talked about and emphasized
  the importance of seeking excellence. Now they didn’t say it that way, but I think
  that’s the bottom line of what they were talking about. They would always—and I
  can hear them now telling me, Whatever you do in life, do it as well as you can.
  You’re going to be a garbage collector, be the best garbage collector you can be.
  If you’re going to be a doctor, be the best doctor you can be. Not as good as the
  next doctor or garbage collector, but the best one you can be. And that’s something
  that they preached and, I think, has served me well over time.\nJH: I think I recall
  you talking about, you know, at a pretty young age, having some experiences or influences
  that sort of made you think you might want to be a lawyer someday. Can you talk
  about that a little bit?\nAP: I very early on, you know, when I was eight, nine,
  ten years old, people would ask me what I wanted to do when I grew up and I would
  say I wanted to be a lawyer. And, you know, what eight-year-old knows really what
  they want to do when they grow up? But, as I noted, I grew up in Canton, Ohio. It
  was a town built on heavy industry, primarily steel, and I had an uncle who spent
  forty years working in the steel mill. And I knew intuitively that that’s not something
  that I wanted to do. Nothing wrong with working in steel mills, but from my eight-\n00:05:00
  year-old eyes, the work was dirty; it was hard; it was dangerous and repetitious.
  And\nsomehow I knew that that didn’t fit me.\nI’d heard stories about lawyers, that,
  you know, from—not that I knew any lawyers, or had any lawyers in my family or my
  family really knew any lawyers, but the impression in the community I grew up was
  that lawyers didn’t work too hard; made lots of money; drove big, fancy cars; lived
  in big houses and went out and played golf every Wednesday afternoon. But for the
  eight-year-old mind balancing fancy cars and dangerous and dirty work—\nJH: Which
  do I choose?\nAP: Which do I choose? It becomes real simple. I also grew up watching
  Perry Mason [Perry Mason, CBS television from September 21, 1957, to May 22, 1966],
  and so I had a very rudimentary sense of what the law was about from that television
  show and finally, and something that influenced me greatly. You have to remember
  that I grew up—I was eight years old in 1954. At the time our country was grounded
  in state sponsored segregation and in 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown versus
  the Board of Education[of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483] and I can remember reading newspaper
  stories about it; hearing people talk about it; and again, not that I understood
  it fully, but it gave me a sense of the power that the law has. That if the courts,
  through the law, could essentially sound the death knell for state sponsored segregation,
  it had the power to change how people treat one another. And that’s something that
  I grew up [with] and had an interest in.\nAs I got older, I was disabused of the
  idea that lawyers didn’t work hard (laughter) or that they necessarily made lots
  and lots of money, but I also developed the sense that the law was 4\nabout solving
  problems and helping people and that’s also something that resonated with me. And
  so that was sort of my dream for the future. And never lost it, never lost it. And,
  again, you know, 1954 there was Brown. Along the way there were—there was Little
  Rock [Little Rock, AR]; there was Birmingham [Birmingham, AL]; there were full blown
  civil rights movements, an effort to change or address issues of race in ways that
  hadn’t been successful in the past. And, I’m sure that all had some bearing on my
  sense of what the law was about and what could be done with the law.\nJH: You know,
  thinking about Brown v. Board, specifically, do you, I mean, what was Canton like
  growing up sort of in terms of a racial makeup? Was it a pretty segregated, in fact,
  city?\nAP: Absolutely. Absolutely. You knew where you belonged and didn’t belong
  and it’s interesting. I didn’t grow up in an area where the segregation was state
  sponsored, but in practical effect, it might as well have been.\n00:10:00 JH: So
  let’s talk briefly about Central Catholic High School, your high school experience\nin
  Canton. Was it the plan for you to attend Central Catholic because your family did
  or was it football related, or what was the trajectory there?\nAP: Well, our family
  moved from Canton out into the countryside with an East Canton, Ohio, address because
  my parents felt that the education available in the Canton city schools wasn’t what
  they wanted for us. And my two older sisters, interestingly, didn’t decide to go
  to school in East Canton. They, and along with my parents, concluded that Canton
  Central Catholic had the best possible education for our circumstances. And so they
  ended up going to Central Catholic. And then, my brother, who was ahead of me, he
  went and so, I was destined to follow.\nAnd I—before I got to high school, I hadn’t
  really—I wasn’t much of an athlete as a kid; I wasn’t one of those kids that everybody
  sort of sought after to come and be on their team, but my brother went out for football
  and so when I got there, I went out and it, as it turns out, I evidently had some
  aptitude for it.\nJH: I’ve heard you use that phrase, “Have some aptitude for it,”
  before, yeah. So what do you, in terms of high school, do you remember having an
  early interest in sort of the law and politics and those sort of things or were
  you still sort of navigating and not quite sure—?\nAP: I think I was always interested
  in politics from very early on. But only in the sense of trying to figure out how
  it works to help people. I never had much interest in politics for politics’ sake.
  And so when I got to high school, I mean, I—the courses I loved were, you know,
  back then it was civics and government—those kind of classes.\nJH: So was there
  a point—so you played football at Central Catholic and is there a point, even in
  high school, where you think that football could be used as a way to pursue an education
  or does that realization not happen until a little bit later or—?\n5\nAP: You know,
  growing up in Canton, there was this conflict between athletics and academics. There
  was a very strong emphasis on athletics, particularly in the African-American community
  and so I’m growing up not much interested in football and seeing an inordinate number
  of young men who had—I guess what you would call stellar high school football careers—go
  off to college for two, three, four years, come back to Canton, ended up hanging
  out on the street corner, unemployed and unemployable. And, you know, that didn’t
  make sense to me. I couldn’t figure out—this was before I started playing football.
  Then I started playing, as I said, more by accident than by design and I loved playing
  but I was just playing football because I loved it and not for any other purpose.\n00:15:00
  By the time I was a, you know, sophomore/junior, there was talk that I might be
  able to obtain\nan athletic scholarship and so I suppose around that time I started
  thinking about [how] it could be used. One of the, in hindsight, one of the disappointments
  when I look back is that while I did okay as a student in high school; did okay
  as a student in elementary and junior high school; I did it the easy way. I didn’t,
  essentially I wasn’t there to learn how to learn. I was there to do the work and
  I could do the work without learning how to learn. I could, you know, answer the
  questions and work through the math problems and all of that but simply because
  you can do the work, doesn’t mean that you’re really learning a whole lot because,
  I think, the important part of what goes on in schools in the education process
  is learning how to learn and so I sort of missed that.\nAnd so as, in high school,
  the work got more difficult, I still, you know, thrived to some degree, but had
  I learned how to learn early on, I think, I mean, I was focused on going to school
  beyond high school because that was the emphasis my parents placed, but if I had
  sort of made that connection to learning how to learn early on, I might have had
  a little more success academically and not, I don’t focus on that so much because,
  you know, I could have been—done better in school—but I would have been better prepared
  for the future.\nAs it turned out, I did okay, and ended up receiving a number of
  scholarship offers, athletic scholarship offers. I think had I had that—had I learned
  how to learn—there might have been some academic scholarships in that queue also,
  which gives you choices, right?\nJH: Sure.\nAP: But I had the opportunity to choose
  among some pretty good schools and ultimately selected the University of Notre Dame
  [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN].\nJH: That’s a good transition to Notre
  Dame and talk a little bit about your time in college. Why Notre Dame?\nAP: Primarily
  because of its academic reputation and because of its reputation in terms of how
  it interacted with its alumni. They have an incredible, had then, and continue to
  have, an incredible alumni association which provides any number of benefits to
  people who graduate\n00:20:00 from there in terms of employment opportunities and
  other kinds of support. And, you know,\nas I say, the schools that I was choosing
  from, they were all good schools. I mean, it was Purdue [Purdue University, 610
  Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN]; it was Michigan State 6\n[Michigan State University,
  220 Trowbridge Road, East Lansing, MI]; it was Michigan [University of Michigan,
  500 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI]; Minnesota [University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,
  MN]; Ohio State [Ohio State University, Columbus, OH]. So it wasn’t like they didn’t
  have some of the things that Notre Dame had to offer. But it was sort of looking
  beyond the college years that was, I think, ultimately the deciding factor.\nThat,
  coupled with, I had no interest in going to Ohio State, who knows why? And Notre
  Dame also had this reputation, football wise, that, at least at the time, was about
  as good as it got, you know, to a black kid from Canton, Ohio, going to play in
  the house that Knute Rockne [Knute Kenneth Rockne (March 4, 1888–March 31, 1931)]
  built, that sort of put stars in your eyes for sure.\nJH: So was that an exciting
  time I would suspect in a lot of ways? Was it a nerve wracking time transitioning
  from Canton and leaving home, or—?\nAP: It was an exciting time; a very difficult
  time. I, you know, just going back to Central Catholic, I was one of two, I think,
  maybe three; maybe four; African-American kids in my graduating class. Going off
  to Notre Dame it was going to be, you know, there were a few more, but not many
  more so—and it was at a time that sort of our national economy was sort of in a
  downward spiral and Notre Dame is in South Bend, Indiana, and they were also a heavy
  industry town and one of the main employers there was Studebaker, the auto manufacturer,
  and they went out of business just about the time I got there. It was my first time
  away from home really. I’d not been a kid who’d gone off to camp and spent any time
  away from home so it was all new to me. And it was also, you know, the first time
  that I’d really been put in a position where I was responsible for myself as every
  kid who goes off to school is.\nJH: Sure, that’s a big change.\nAP: A huge change.
  And so it was difficult. And one of the things I didn’t realize was Notre Dame was
  not the most progressive place to go to school and so that was something that was
  a little different for me and having to adjust to that. There were some difficult
  transitions.\nJH: Speaking to kind of the economy, in a downturn, thinking about
  that time, too, and in a lot of ways the civil rights movement is sort of at its
  apex and the Voting Rights Act and so was that a part of the campus conversation
  or do you recall anything about that?\n00:25:00 AP: Not much, a little bit, but
  not much. You know, and being on the football team there,\nyou really weren’t necessarily
  that much a part of the campus conversation, even though we were—we lived in the
  dorms with everybody else and went to meals with everybody else and went to classes
  with everybody else, your focal point was football and so you weren’t really much
  connected.\nAnd it was really kind of an interesting time in that respect because,
  I mean, the civil rights movement was going through some challenging times. About
  the same time, the Vietnam War protests started and so it’s sort of like you’re
  in this bubble looking out on all of this and not 7\nhaving a direct connection
  to it but having the opportunity to at least see it and think about it but not engage.\nJH:
  Well, it’s interesting you mention that because yeah, in thinking about it, the
  focus on football and you’re a young kid still and transitioning so maybe not a
  lot of capacity for a lot of other stuff when that’s the focus in a lot of ways.\nAP:
  Even if you had the instinct, they took up your time and your energy, both physical
  and emotional. And so it was, in that respect, I missed out on a lot but, you know,
  I can’t remember the precise timing, but my freshman year, the start of my freshman
  year, went to football training camp a couple of weeks before school started and
  I think we got there either just before or just after the March on Washington [The
  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 1963]. I think school had started
  by the time the bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church [The 16th Street
  Baptist Church bombing. September 15, 1963), Birmingham, AL] had occurred in Birmingham.
  And so you had all of these things going on. As I noted, you’re sort of watching
  from afar. And understanding that they affect you, but sort of not directly.\nJH:
  Removed a little bit or, yeah. Well, the focus on football bore some fruit. National
  championship—was it your senior year?\nAP: Yes. I should note, I think it was in
  the—I think it was still while I was there or he was planning to come, one of our
  speakers, one of the people who was coming to campus to speak was George Wallace
  [George Corley Wallace Jr. (August 25, 1919–September 13, 1998)]. That got people
  engaged.\nJH: That got some attention?\nAP: That got some attention.\nJH: Did he
  come? Do you remember?\nAP: I’m pretty sure it was while I was still there. Needless
  to say, I didn’t attend.\nJH: Yeah, probably not a regret.\nAP: No.\nJH: So, you’re
  drafted by the Vikings kind of at the close of your career at Notre Dame and kind
  of moving ahead a little bit, there’s obviously lots to talk about that we could
  talk\n00:30:00 about with respect to your professional career in the NFL and—\nAP:
  It happened.\nJH: It happened. It happened. You’ve talked about it a little bit,
  right? But I want to focus on just kind of one unique aspect that I was interested
  about was your participation in the NFL 8\nPlayers Association. It’s something that
  I, you know, I’ve—I know you’ve talked about it before but we don’t hear that quite
  as often so I was just curious. You’re playing with the Vikings. How do you get
  involved in the Players Association and what’s sort of your role?\nAP: Well, there
  had been—this is a long, complicated story, too long and too complicated for here.\nJH:
  It’s a big question.\nAP: There had been various efforts on the part of players
  to organize before 1968. Nineteen sixty the league is confronted with another football
  league, the American Football League. In 1966, those two leagues merge with the
  merger taking place in ’68 and in 1968, the players from both leagues come together
  and form the National Football League Players Association. That was my second year
  in the league and somehow I either volunteered or agreed to serve as player representative.
  So that’s how I got involved.\nAnd, growing up in Canton, I was used to organized
  labor and had sort of a sense of what it was about and the other piece of it was
  that the reason players wanted to come together to form a union was because—well,
  there are a whole host of them, not the least of which is players essentially had
  no rights in terms of where they could play; very little ability to impact how much
  they were paid and then there were all these what I will call silly little rules
  that were imposed, I suppose, as a matter of control. That’s all I can think of.
  Things like you can’t have a beard or a mustache. I guess you could have a mustache
  but you couldn’t have a beard. Things like, you know, you have to be at every meal
  whether you want to eat or not. You have to—you can’t have a telephone in your room
  and this was before, you know, mobile phones, but you couldn’t have the telephone
  company put a phone in your room during training camp. I mean, those are just a
  couple that come to mind.\nAnd so there were really lots of limitations on a player’s
  ability to be themselves and players wanted to change that and obviously, the ability
  to choose where you worked would have an\n00:35:00 impact on how much you were paid.
  And so, I think for me, at least in the beginning, it was\nsort of all those little
  controls that just drove me crazy, that got me involved. And, you know, once you—you
  can’t get just a little bit wet once you’re into the pool you get all wet.\nJH:
  Did you enjoy it?\nAP: I loved it. It was frustrating at times but I think we laid
  the groundwork for the freedom that players have today. We laid the groundwork for
  players getting a fair share of the revenue. We laid the groundwork that allowed
  players to be treated like human beings as opposed to, in some sense, property.
  And along the way, I got to meet, know and work with a bunch of great lawyers. Leonard
  Lindquist [Leonard Lindquist (September 5, 1912-September 10, 2004)]; Gene Keating
  [Eugene Henry Keating (January 2, 1932-April 6, 2005)]; Ed Glennon [Edward M. Glennon
  (1924-April 24, 2009)]; Ed Garvey [Edward R. Garvey (April 18, 1940–February 22,
  2017)]. I got to see from the inside what the law was all about and what good lawyering
  looks like.\n9\nJH: So is it fair to say that that was an influence on the decision
  to pursue a career?\nAP: That just confirmed—\nJH: That it was something you wanted
  to do.\nAP: That it was something I wanted to do. I enrolled at William Mitchell
  [now Mitchell Hamline School of Law, 875 Summit Avenue, St. Paul, MN] in the fall
  of 1968. I started my second year the league and it was not pretty.\nJH: Why not?\nAP:
  Well, you know, you get that assignment over the summer and there are like five
  hundred pages to read and you try to read it and none of it makes sense and you
  show up the first day and I don’t remember what the class was, but the professor
  could just as well be talking Greek as English. And, you think, I don’t understand
  what’s happening here because it’s a different process; at least it was a different
  process from what my undergraduate degree was like. And I was not ready for it.\nJH:
  Was it—well, you said you were second year in the league, playing and so was it—I
  mean, I’d suspect that obviously that has—playing is a lot of—the time commitment
  in and of itself so was it that you weren’t quite ready? Not enough time? Or did
  it—?\nAP: It wasn’t that. It was being confronted with being in this class and listening
  to these lectures that had no context.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And therefore made no sense.
  And, you know, it’s early on in the process so you don’t know how it all fits together.\nJH:
  New language.\nAP: New language, all of it. And I just—it was not pretty. (laughter)\nJH:
  Well, but it must not have—but it didn’t dissuade you, obviously, completely.\nAP:
  I say only half in jest, I knew after three days that I wasn’t going to survive,
  but I was in so far over my head that it took me another three and a half, three
  weeks to figure out how to drop out, to get out. And I—what I came to understand
  was, first of all, that I wasn’t alone.\n00:40:00 I mean, I’m sitting there thinking,
  I’m the only one that doesn’t get this. I’m the only one that\ndoesn’t understand
  this. But, you know, everybody in the room was in the same boat that I was. Had
  I—maybe had I not been playing football at the time, I’d have sort of stuck it out,
  but I mean, I was so far in over my head, I mean, I just couldn’t see—\n10\nJH:
  The path.\nAP: The path.\nJH: Yep, overwhelming.\nAP: And so, I bailed. But didn’t
  necessarily give up the hope or the idea. Over the years I tried one or two other
  career options. I was a used car salesman or actually a new/used car salesman. I
  sold one car during my auto sales experience.\nJH: I did not know that, that you
  tried that.\nAP: And the one car I sold to myself. (laughter) So I figured there
  was no career in that. I had a vending machine company for about a year and half.
  It took me—I invested about forty thousand dollars into it and it took me about
  a year and a half to go through that, although that was one of the—actually not
  one of—the best investment I ever made and we’ll get to that later, but one of the
  things I was learning was business, being in business, was not something that fit
  me; not something that interested me; not something that I wanted to put the time
  and energy and effort into becoming good at, which was a good lesson to learn. And
  ultimately, after my eighth year with the Vikings, I decided to go back to law school;
  this time having a better understanding, having been involved in, as a players’
  rep, and then ultimately on the executive committee of the Players Association;
  been involved in a number of lawsuits involving the Players Association and the
  National Football League.\nStill, having the opportunity to see even more deeply
  how lawyers work, the way they thought, developing a sense for that and having the
  opportunity to talk with them and sort of learn that law school is just like that
  and that the secret to it is to endure. And at some point it starts to make sense.
  So after my eighth year I decided to go back. This time enrolled at the University
  of Minnesota and actually started the summer of 1975 at the University of Texas
  in Austin [Austin, TX]. I took contracts and procedures, thirteen weeks start to
  finish.\nJH: Wow!\nAP: And survived it.\nJH: There you go.\nAP: Not only survived
  it; loved every minute of it.\nJH: Confidence booster?\nAP: Big confidence booster.\nJH:
  Absolutely.\n11\nAP: Big confidence booster. Learned, you know, a little bit of
  the process of, remember how I talked about having failed to learn how to learn?\nJH:
  Exactly.\nAP: Took me to law school to get it.\nJH: Sometimes I wonder if it takes
  a lot of people up until that point. In some ways, I sort\n00:45:00 of felt the
  same way.\nAP: Well, but once I got it—\nJH: Yeah.\nAP: there’s nothing else like
  it.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And so I loved the law school experience. People, you know,
  are always talking about, Well, you went to law school and played professional football—how
  hard that must have been. Yeah, things are hard but when you’re having fun, there’s
  nothing better. I mean, I loved my law school experience at the university.\nAnd
  I had another one of those defining moments and I think it was towards the end of
  my first year. We had a paper to write and I decided I was going to, you know, take
  the easy road, something you know about, labor, labor law. And actually I think
  I wrote something on labor relations in the NFL. But I, you know, I spent all this
  time doing the research and preparing and I just—nothing happened. And I can remember
  going in to see one of the associate or assistant deans and saying, I don’t know
  that I can do this. And he said, Well, you can do it. All you have to do is apply
  yourself. And I think, What have I been doing?\nJH: Well, that clears it up, right?\nAP:
  Right. And he said, No, you apply the seat of your pants to the chair until you
  get it, until it starts coming and, you know, it’s weird but, you know, I sat down,
  got my books and my pens and my papers and sat there and eventually started writing
  and got it done. And that was an important lesson—that sometimes even when you know
  what you want to do, but it’s not coming together, you have to just keep working
  at it until it happens.\nJH: This is jumping ahead a little bit so we’ll have to
  swing back but that makes me think about the process of sitting down and writing
  an opinion a little bit, too. Is there a similarity there, too? The process of just
  needing to sit down and sort of delve in to get it started and once it’s started,
  flows a little bit?\nAP: It flows. Absolutely.\n12\nJH: Interesting. So law school
  at U of M. I was going to ask you and I think you really answered it was, you know,
  by the time you do go to the U of M, you’re still playing; raising a family; not
  like there aren’t any other things going on. You’re busy but you manage it by—\nAP:
  But then it’s just a matter of time management.\nJH: Sure.\nAP: And figuring out
  how to, you know, make it all work, putting all the pieces together. And I mean,
  I did have some incentive. I mean, by then I was twelve years into my professional
  career. You don’t play forever and quite frankly, I didn’t want to necessarily play
  forever. As I’ve said often, by the time I started law school, I’d been playing
  for—I was into my ninth year and I hadn’t done everything you could do on a football
  field but I’d done most of them and I noted earlier, repetition wasn’t one of my
  strong suits. It was time to prepare to do something different so that I could move
  on. As I’ve often said, you know, the skills of a defensive tackle don’t transfer
  to much of anything else out in the real world and so preparing\n00:50:00 to do
  something beyond football was really important. And law school was that preparation.\nJH:
  Right. So you graduate from law school and you graduate and —you graduate and—what’s
  the timing there? You still play for a little bit after you graduate?\nAP: I played
  three and a half more years.\nJH: Three and a half more years and so you’re—\nAP:
  Seventy-eight; seventy-nine [1979]. Four more years.\nJH: Okay. During that time,
  then, you graduate, you’re playing, but then you start at Lindquist and Vennum [Lindquist
  \u0026 Vennum, offices in Minnesota, Colorado, and South Dakota; formed in 1968
  when Lindquist, Magnuson \u0026 Glennon combined with Vennum, Newhall, Ackman \u0026
  Goetz. As of January 1, 2018, the firm merged with and took the name of Ballard
  Spahr]. So what’s the practice there like? Tell me about that a little bit.\nAP:
  It’s trying to figure out who you are as a lawyer. And it’s, you know, getting assignments
  and, you know, Here’s the file. Go do this. And it’s like, How do you go do this?
  (laughter)\nJH: A little more explanation.\nAP: Would be helpful. It wasn’t always
  forthcoming. Sort of get thrown into the thick of things and there were some horrible,
  awful, very bad moments where I had no idea what I was doing but had to try to figure
  it out while I was doing it.\nJH: Enjoyable though?\nAP: Not especially. 13\nJH:
  No?\nAP: One of the things I figured out early on about the private practice of
  law, it’s about business; it’s about billing hours and that just—it never—that is
  not me. My interest in the law was the law and trying to sort of work through it,
  sort it out and figure it out and come to the best conclusions that you can. And
  when you’ve got this little thing sitting on your shoulder talking about billable
  hours, first of all, you’re distracted by that because you’re thinking, Hey, am
  I billing enough hours and how do I justify these hours? And so from that standpoint,
  it was not necessarily pleasant.\nThat said, I got to work with some really good
  lawyers and like every other new lawyer, Can you do a memo for me on this? And you
  give them the memo and it comes back and it’s like, I didn’t know there was that
  much red ink in the world. (laughter)\nJH: But lessons, then, as well, I suppose,
  too, right, so you’re—\nAP: Absolutely.\nJH: it’s a big learning curve but you’re
  learning a lot.\nAP: But you’re learning a lot. That’s where I got grounded and
  so from that standpoint, it was a very valuable experience but just not my idea
  of a good time. And I was fortunate enough to make my way to the attorney general’s
  office and I loved it there because Skip Humphrey [Hubert Horatio \"Skip\" Humphrey
  III (June 26, 1942-)] was the attorney general and he let the lawyers who were there
  to do the work, do the work. And let me learn to give my best legal advice to my
  clients. Didn’t have to worry about billing hours; didn’t have to worry about clients
  walking away. I could do the best that I could to figure out what is the best—what
  is the law and what is the best advice I can give this client? And I could do that
  and there’s a lot of freedom in that and I absolutely loved it.\n00:55:00 JH: Did
  you have a particular focus in the attorney general’s office?\nAP: Labor and employment.\nJH:
  You were? Okay.\nAP: Labor and employment.\nJH: And you enjoyed that?\nAP: And that’s
  what I did at Lindquist also on the employee side and just flipped to the employer
  side.\nJH: So you’re working at the Minnesota Attorney General’s office four years,
  five years-ish, something like that? 14\nAP: Started in ’85, the first week of January,
  1985, and left the last week of December in 1992.\nJH: Okay, so, yeah. So when do
  you start thinking about—maybe not even necessarily the Minnesota Supreme Court
  but the idea of doing something different and maybe that being judging?\nAP: You
  know, I had this weird experience. In 1982, I’m at Lindquist and Vennum and—’82
  or ’83—and I wake up one morning and the newspaper has an article about Governor
  Perpich [Rudolph George Perpich Sr. (June 27, 1928–September 21, 1995)] is going
  to appoint some new judges and he’s got my name on the list. Nobody had asked.\nJH:
  Interesting.\nAP: It was very strange but up until that point it hadn’t really occurred
  to me a) that I would have the interest in being a judge or that I could be, or
  that I had the skills or temperament. Long story short, made me think about it.
  And, you know, through that time, I’m learning who I am as a lawyer; what my skills
  are; what my interests are; and what my strengths and weaknesses are. And over time,
  I sort of start thinking, Maybe there is something in the judiciary that would fit
  me, but I can’t see myself necessarily as a trial court judge. And, you know, as
  lawyers we spend a lot of time reading opinions and struggling to figure out what
  they mean. And thinking, Well, if they meant this, why didn’t they just say it?
  Why is it so hard to say in plain clear language what you mean?\nAnd of course,
  my ego says to myself, Self, you could do that. You could write clearly. You could
  write concisely and so over time I start to think my skills and my interests, my
  abilities, my strengths lend themselves to what appellate court judges do. And from
  there, well, how does one become an appellate court judge? Well, as you know in
  Minnesota, it’s either by appointment or by election. And the Minnesota Court of
  Appeals is new, relatively new, and most of the judges there or many of the judges
  there had been trial court judges, so that seems like a natural step even though
  the trial court isn’t necessarily what fits me. And so I started applying for trial
  court judge positions and had absolutely no success.\n01:00:00 Eventually I came
  to the conclusion that I wasn’t going to have any success and that, if I\nwanted
  the opportunity to serve, it was probably going to be through election, which narrows
  things down to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And my
  thought process was, Well, if you’re going to seek election, you might as well seek
  election to the Minnesota Supreme Court. I think I have something to contribute.
  I think, both from a legal background, but also from just a different perspective,
  and so, 1990, I decided to seek election. And when the filing period opened, I was
  down there first morning, first hour, filed for election and the justice who I was
  going to challenge; thought I was going to challenge, resigned before I got out
  of the secretary of state’s office. 15\nJH: Oh wow.\nAP: Which created a vacancy.
  Vacancies are filled by appointment. The governor immediately appointed someone
  to fill the vacancy and the election for that seat no longer existed. And I, in
  seeking election, it wasn’t about the individual justice who I was going to challenge;
  it wasn’t about their opinions or their philosophy or their anything else; it was
  simply—it seemed to me to be a fair question given that the justice was going to
  reach mandatory retirement within something less than six months of re-election
  and it was a fair question, at least I thought, to have the people of Minnesota
  decide who they would want to serve the term.\nMe, a known quantity, a known person,
  or some unknown, ultimately some unknown person. The election was taken off the
  ballot and, you know, it wasn’t clear to me why, you know. Being a person of color,
  one of the things that comes to mind is, Is it because I’m a person of color? Is
  it politics? Is it—I don’t know—let that go; continued working at the attorney general’s
  office and decided to try again in 1992.\nThis time, the justice I sought to challenge,
  was going to reach mandatory retirement within about eighteen months of the full
  six-year term and I thought again it was fair question to have the people of Minnesota
  decide who the justice should be who serves in that seat. Before I could get to
  the—before the filings opened, we had this provision in our constitution which provides
  for the retirement of the judges and there is a statute which provided, also provides
  to carry out that constitutional provision, which provided that the governor could
  extend\n01:05:00 the term of a justice who hadn’t reached full retirement at the
  time they were up for re-\nelection and with mandatory retirement approaching. And
  so Justice Yetka [Lawrence R. Yetka (October 1, 1924–November 12, 2017)] who was
  the justice who I was going to challenge, sought a term extension; the governor
  granted it and I was, to say the least, more than a little frustrated.\nAnd so,
  long story short, I commenced a lawsuit against the governor and the secretary of
  state, a lawsuit that had its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court and a number
  of people told me I was crazy, that you’re wrong on the law; you’re wrong on the
  politics and you’re never, you know, when you lose this lawsuit, you’re never, ever
  going to have the opportunity to serve.\nI felt strongly about one, that the, as
  applied, the term extension violated the constitution. I wasn’t much concerned about
  the politics because I’d been—sort of along the way I’d figured out you have to
  do what you think is right, not what is expedient, and turns out I was right on
  the law; we were right on the law. And I was given the opportunity, along with anybody
  else who wanted to file for election for the seat. I filed; Justice Yetka did not
  and two other people did and almost immediately, not almost immediately, immediately,
  my opponents started down the road of, He''s just a football player. And initially,
  implicit, but unstated, he’s just a dumb football player. Also initially, but not
  necessarily subsequently, but initially, he’s just a dumb, black football player.
  I mean, that was the tenor of what was being said. He’s not qualified. 16\nI spent
  the next three months, three and a half months, whatever it is, campaigning around
  the state to talk about why I wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. What I could
  bring what I had to offer about my experience and my background and my qualifications.
  And at every turn, I got the accusatory question, What are your qualifications?
  And nobody else was being asked that. And so that was difficult. That said, it was
  also satisfying to be able to talk to people about who I am and what I thought I
  had to offer and in the end, the people of this state gave\n01:10:00 me the opportunity
  to serve. They elected me. I am humbled, honored. I have a hard time\narticulating
  how meaningful it is to me that they saw through the effort to stereotype me; that
  they saw in me somebody who hopefully, had something to contribute and they gave
  me the opportunity to do it.\nJH: Was—so, you know, you mentioned that, in terms
  of the campaign, questions about qualification, but implicit questions about—\nAP:
  Race.\nJH: what it means to be an athlete—race. Was diversity, and the fact that,
  if elected, you’d be the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice:
  Was that a part of that conversation explicitly or was that not really a part of
  that discussion?\nAP: That wasn’t a part of the discussion.\nJH: So you’re elected.\nAP:
  And I show up the first day.\nJH: What’s the first day like?\nAP: Well, I had a
  month before, I’d been given briefs for the—\nJH: Get to work.\nAP: Yes, for the
  argument calendar in January of ’93, and initially I had been assigned a case that
  was being heard that first day.\nJH: Okay.\nAP: Mind you, I had—I didn’t know how
  the system worked, right?\nJH: Right. The norms, the processes—\nAP: The norms,
  the processes, any of it. And so I’m fast tracking, trying to figure all this out
  and it turns out the case that they gave me, I had a conflict. Phew! So they switched
  cases and gave me one for the second day. I was getting my baptism by fire. I, you
  know, read the briefs, prepared—didn’t know what—and for my case the second day,
  as you know, we do a 17\nreport to the court, I’d never done a report to the court
  because I hadn’t been on the court. But I had to sort of figure that out but I had
  no sort of context for doing that. And the—I was sworn in before the first argument
  the first day and we were having a public ceremony after it.\nJH: That very first
  day.\nAP: That very first day, public swearing in.\nJH: There were some distractions
  beyond the work of the court.\nAP: One or two. And sat through the one argument
  because I was recused on the other but sat through my first case conference and
  learned what a report was like. Do the public swearing in ceremony; celebrate with
  family, and at the end of the day, get that report written.\nJH: And that report
  on your mind kind of throughout the day a little bit?\nAP: Oh, absolutely.\nJH:
  Yeah, I got to get that report; I’ve got some work to do.\nAP: I’ve got some work
  to do. At least now I know what it is. And the second day I had\n01:15:00 my—we
  had the two cases I sat through, gave my report and that’s the way it begins. We\ndon’t
  do that anymore. At least when I left the court, new justices had some time to learn
  the system.\nJH: So was that a, I mean, do you think back on the first—beyond the
  first day or two, the first week; the first month, as I said, because it was trial
  by fire a little bit right away that it was an easy transition? I mean, hard by
  the way, but a quick one or—?\nAP: Invigorating, and a very quick transition. You
  know, as with anything new, particularly in the world of work, you don’t know the
  rules and the norms until you violate them and so you’re trying to figure it all
  out and, you know, you have your missteps along the way but you figure it out and,
  as with many things, the question isn’t whether you made the mistake, but what did
  you learn from it. In this particular instance, I had to be a quick learner and
  I was.\nJH: Absolutely.\nAP: And then, you know, you get that first case behind
  you, the argument and the report, and then you’ve got to write—\nJH: You’ve got
  some more work to do. It’s not over.\nAP: And having never written an opinion before,
  you have to learn how to do that.\nJH: Which is a whole other beast in and of itself.
  18\nAP: Absolutely, but I had a good law clerk, Ian Nemiroff, who helped me a lot.
  He helped me a lot. And as over the years, I had a bunch of great clerks who made
  me look good time and time again.\nJH: I wanted to ask about clerks, not in a selfish
  way, but it’s definitely a part of your work on the court, daily work on the court.
  What did you look for in a clerk?\nAP: I looked for people who were curious; people
  who had something in their background that was out of the norm. Justice Gardebring
  [Sandra Gardebring Ogren (June 14, 1947–July 20, 2010)] used to refer to what she
  called Standard Issue Law Students, SILS (laughter). I didn’t want Standard Issue
  Law clerks. I wanted people who—obviously you want somebody that can write; you
  want somebody that’s going to work hard. But you want somebody who’s going to have
  good judgment and a sense of curiosity to sort of look under the rocks that need
  to be looked under and not under the ones that don’t and who can figure that out
  pretty quickly. And who are willing to or who were willing to tell me when I was
  wrong. I didn’t need a law clerk or law clerks who would tell me what I want to
  hear. I don’t like surprises and so, when I’m working with a clerk, I want the clerk
  to make sure there are no surprises.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And I was pretty lucky along
  the way—a bunch of great writers, yourself included; hard workers; curiosity—you
  fit the bill nicely.\nJH: Well, it’s—I always talk about, too. It’s one of those
  incredible experiences where you get out of law school and then the work, in many
  ways, it feels like some of the most\n01:20:00 important work that you’ll do as
  an attorney, working on the court so pretty incredible\nexperience.\nSo talk about—I
  recall in the year in your office—\nAP: I should also note, I wanted diversity in
  my clerks. I wanted women; I wanted clerks who were people of color; I wanted diversity
  in their, you know, where they came from; what their experiences were—because all
  of that makes; all of that enriches the process and makes what I do as a judge better
  having different views, different ways of looking at things and I mean, I think
  that’s vital.\nJH: Your approach to tackling an opinion. I remember you taking,
  I think, a lot of joy in peeling apart the layers, finding the resolution, and obviously,
  as you’ve said many times before, none of the cases that come before the Minnesota
  Supreme Court are simple. They’re there because they’re complex. Talk about that
  a little bit.\nAP: They’re there because they’re complex; they’re there because
  they’re important to the people involved in them, no matter who they are, whether
  it’s a—the fifth petition for review from a post-conviction inmate, or, you know,
  some large corporation, it’s important to the people that we serve. It’s important
  to the people of the state that we do it well and that we do 19\nit as right as
  we can. And I—opinion writing is—on any given day I will tell you it’s more art
  than science or that it’s more science than art.\nJH: Right.\nAP: It’s really a
  combination of both and for me, it was very important to work with the word so that
  what the opinion said was clear, easily understood, easily read and helpful. And
  to do that for me, it was about making sure that there were no unintended words,
  much less unintended ideas but no unintended words that—every word was thought about;
  that every word was where it was in the sentence because that’s the best use of
  the word in communicating the idea that you’re trying to communicate. That every
  sentence in the paragraph was where it was because that was the best way to communicate
  what you were trying to communicate in the paragraph. That every paragraph in the
  opinion was where it was because that’s where it was most helpful.\n01:25:00 I suspect
  that you clerks probably thought I was a little obsessive and maybe even a little\ncompulsive
  but certainly obsessive about words, how we used the language, but that was important
  to me; that was very important to me.\nJH: I remember you talked right away about
  the purpose of every word. If it doesn’t have a role; if it’s not there for a reason,\nAP:
  Gone.\nJH: Get it out.\nAP: If it doesn’t have a reason, it’s not helping anybody.
  All it does is add length and the potential for confusion.\nJH: And the potential
  for interpretation differently than the intent was.\nAP: Different than what you
  intended.\nJH: Right, I remember that lesson. It sticks with me for sure. I was
  always struck with the collegiality and rapport on the court. You know, it was a
  serious place; a lot of important work, but I also remember, at least feeling like,
  the justices had a lot of respect for one another and were good friends as well.
  Can you speak to that a little bit?\nAP: Well, you know, it’s interesting. You have
  seven people, and changing all the time, who have big brains; who would like to
  think they’re the smartest one in the room; who have views that conflict and who
  feel strongly about their opinions. But we’ve been lucky here in Minnesota to have
  people understand that the institution is more important than any one of us and
  institutionally, it is important to maintain that collegiality, even when your colleagues,
  in your view, are so far wrong that you can’t understand how they could possibly
  be there. And sometimes the tension is pretty high but in the end you have to understand
  that a.) it’s about the institution and the work; it’s not about me. And also, you
  have to understand that, you 20\nknow, some day you may need that colleague to get
  where you want to go in a particular case or where you think a case should go.\nWhen
  I first got on the court I would hear these stories about what was going on in other
  states with their Supreme Courts. Justices inviting one another out into the corridor
  to have a fight; justices showing up at conference and placing a handgun on the
  conference table. How does that work? How can you have a justice system that—or
  that the members of which of\n01:30:00 their courts are so antagonistic with one
  another that they can’t be civil even, you know, under\npressure? How do you reach
  good decisions doing that? I don’t think you can. One of the things that was also,
  I think, important for our court during my time there, to ensure the understanding
  that collegiality was important and that it’s the institution, it’s not us, was
  that we, in our conference, you know, there are seven of us. We know each other
  by first name. We refer to each other as Justice So and So, just to make it clear
  in our own minds and everybody else in the room, that this is an institutional decision
  we’re making. This is the institution that is acting; it’s not me, Alan Page, making
  a decision. I’m making it on behalf of this institution. And it’s a way to sort
  of force you to treat people with respect and I think it served us well.\nJH: Those
  small things are not small things.\nAP: Not small at all.\nJH: Right.\nAP: Not small
  at all.\nJH: Right. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the first—the critical
  first of being the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice? Sort
  of looking back and thinking about the role of that first in your work on the court?\nAP:
  I have a hard time doing that because that wasn’t what it was about. Institutionally,
  I think it’s important that there had to be a first. Institutionally, it would have
  been better had it been somebody long before me. The fact that it finally happened—that
  we finally opened the door if you will for people of color, I think it was very
  significant. I think equally significant was the fact that when I joined the court,
  the court was a majority of women.\nJH: That’s right.\nAP: People would ask me,
  What’s it like serving on the court with a majority of women, right? And, of course,
  having not served on a court that wasn’t a majority of women, I thought, Well, that’s
  the natural order of things. But those things are important—that our judicial—that
  people who serve in our judicial system reflect the people of this state. I’ve said
  many times that the only power that courts have is founded in the trust and confidence
  of the people we serve and the less the members of the judiciary look like the people
  they serve, the less trust and confidence our judiciary will have. And so I think
  finally breaking that barrier was critically important. 21\n01:35:00 JH: Right.
  On that note, I mean, early on in your tenure as a justice—and I want to get this\nright—your
  service on the Minnesota Supreme Court Task Force on Racial Bias in the Judicial
  System. Report’s issued in 1993.\nAP: Six months after I joined the court.\nJH:
  Right. And you were involved.\nAP: Well, I—\nJH: Can you just describe that a little
  bit or what was your participation; what was your experience?\nAP: I became the
  chair of the committee that was going to implement the task force report. That was
  challenging for me. Remember my interest in the law was the law and not in being
  an administrator? And so from that standpoint, a lot of the things that, not only
  that committee, but we all—we had various committee assignments. I have to say those
  committee assignments were not my favorite part of being on the court.\nBut this
  was an important one and, you know, we ended up working through the—depending on
  how you count them—the one hundred plus recommendations, pretty much most of them
  being implemented. But—and the implementation made things better but it didn’t solve
  the problem. It was a little—I think we made very incremental progress. But the
  disparities that came out of the report, particularly in the criminal justice area,
  where African-Americans, people of color are arrested more often; stopped more often;
  charged more often; given higher bail; less fair trials; higher conviction rates;
  longer sentences; all things being equal, that hasn’t ended and that’s just on the
  criminal justice side. There’s the juvenile justice and all the other aspects of
  the report.\nI’ve more or less come to the conclusion that before real change is
  going to happen, we have to take a more fundamental look at what our law is grounded
  in, which is to say, it’s grounded in a constitution that counted those imported
  as slaves as three-fifths of a person. And while we’ve had the thirteenth, fourteenth
  and fifteenth amendments ending slavery, ensuring due process and guaranteeing the
  right to vote, the law itself, the foundation, is still on cases that arose out
  of slavery and we’ve got to figure out how to tease that out of it before we have
  fundamental change.\nJH: Structural fundamental change, right?\n01:40:00 AP: It’s
  a structural, systemic problem.\nJH: What about, Justice Page, any notable opinions;
  dissents; anything come to mind? You wrote a lot so it’s a big body of work but—?\n22\nAP:
  I have never, in my own head, quantified or qualified whether it was a dissent or
  an opinion in terms of its importance. It seems to me that once you do that; once
  you decide that this one is more important than that one, you start doing both of
  them a disservice. And so I just took each one as they came and tried to put the
  same energy and effort into trying to get it right. And again, as I say, whether
  it was that fifth post-conviction petition, or, you know, some mega million dollar
  corporate issue, the people who come before us deserve to have our fullest attention
  and so I just don’t qualify them, quantify them in that way.\nJH: Don’t think of
  it as that, right? So, during your tenure on the court, one thing I wanted to ask
  you about, too, is just sort of the interplay, if you think of there being one at
  all, between your continued community engagement and still working on the court.
  You know, we would—I think back a lot on going and reading with you and other staff
  in the court, reading to elementary school kids on Wednesdays or whatever day it
  was. That community engagement and, you know, did that play a role in your work
  in your works as a justice? Did you see it sort of separately or was it related
  and did it inform your work?\nAP: Oh, I think everything we do -- our lives inform
  our work. I don’t know that I, you know, my reading with kids or my involvement
  to the extent that I had it, which was quite limited at the Page Education Foundation,
  influenced my work directly but it’s a part of who I am and being engaged in the
  community around us at some level helps us understand those people we are a part
  of but also who we represent. And I think it would be a mistake to be isolated and
  not a part of the world around us to the extent, obviously, to the extent possible,
  to the extent that it doesn’t create conflicts.\nJH: You’ve had some time now after
  retiring, I suppose to think back. Any, I guess maybe the question is, in thinking
  about it and this kind of gets to some final reflections about your time on the
  court, it’s a big question, but what is it—personally and professionally—can you
  put into words what the service meant to you?\nAP: Well, for me, it was the most,
  in terms of my professional life, the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. The
  challenges of working with seven other people. I mean, I looked forward to every
  day when I was on the court, particularly to those days where we would hear argument
  and have conferences because every conference you got stretched in ways that you
  would never get stretched and I loved that. Trying to understand what your colleagues
  are saying and thinking; trying to understand what you were thinking in the context
  of what they are saying and thinking and trying to understand what you were thinking.\nJH:
  Work through thought processes, right.\nAP: And working through all that doesn’t
  get any better.\nJH: Sometimes arriving at unexpected places, too?\nAP: Oh, all
  the time, all the time. Arriving at unexpected places; arriving at places that,
  on a personal level, you wouldn’t want to arrive at. You—if I could decide this
  on my own, this is not what I would do, but not my choice, you know. One of the—a
  little bit disconcerting 23\nthings about our society—is I don’t think people understand
  how important it is for judges to be impartial and to exercise their judgment and
  not impose their will. And just the challenge of doing that all the time and trying
  to get that right, it’s all very much fun; very invigorating; very satisfying. And,
  hopefully, in the end, I did it as well as I could do it. I leave that up to others
  to decide but that was certainly my goal and I enjoyed every minute of it along
  the way.\nJH: What about the future of the court? You’re not on it, obviously, anymore,
  but thinking about challenges, hopes; any thoughts come to mind about the future?\nAP:
  My hope would be that they continue to be independent; that they continue to act
  impartially and understand that it is about the exercise of judgment and if the
  court’s members can do that it’ll have a bright future. And there’s something about,
  at least from my experience on the court looking back and looking forward, I think
  there’s a pretty good chance that things will continue in that regard as they have.\nThe
  court’s leadership understands. I had the good fortune to serve with, let me think—I
  knew the number exactly at one time. Let’s see—one, two three—I can’t remember the
  exact number—six or seven or eight—\n01:50:00 JH: Chief justices?\nAP: chief justices
  and each one of them got it. They were all different but each one of them understood
  how important it is for our court to maintain its independence and its impartiality
  and to make decisions based on the law and the facts and their best judgment and
  not on the way the wind is blowing today. We’ve been lucky to have really good people,
  both at the chief justice, as chief justices, and as associate justices and I, to
  be included in that group is pretty special.\nJH: You know, I want to definitely,
  before we close out, give you an opportunity to speak to your late wife Diane’s
  [Diane Sims Page (1944-September 30, 2018)], role in your career.\nAP: Well, I mentioned
  earlier about that forty thousand dollars I lost on the vending machines?\nJH: Yeah,
  that’s right.\nAP: The company that owned the vending machines was a subsidiary
  of General Mills.\nJH: I know where this is going now.\nAP: And, long story short,
  I was in the lobby at General Mills one day, having left the meeting and left my
  car keys and everything else in the meeting and I’m sitting, waiting for somebody
  to bring them back to me and Diane walks into a meeting that she was going to there.
  I got introduced to her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Absolutely
  the best thing that ever happened to me. She is the love of my life; she kept me
  grounded at the same time lifting me up. She had this magic ability to lift people
  up, no matter who they 24\nwere; no matter what the circumstances were. She had
  incredible insight into people and she is in large measure the key to much of the
  success that I’ve had. She was there every step of the way, allowing me, encouraging
  me, supporting me. And, as I say, I couldn’t have been luckier to have met her,
  fallen in love with her and spent the years that we had together. And she was one
  of those people who—I have ideas. She was a doer.\nJH: Executor.\nAP: Absolutely,
  and it wasn’t, you know, When are you going to get this done? It’s, Why wasn’t this
  done yesterday? Well, because we just found out that we had to do it today. She
  was in a sense, driven and driven to do good; driven to make this world a better
  place, that’s for sure. And I got lucky.\n01:55:00 JH: Well, you have retired from
  the court but you’re busy.\nAP: I am busy.\nJH: And so I’ve got to ask, what’s next?
  What’s next for Justice Page?\nAP: Well, there’s still plenty of work to do with
  the Page Education Foundation and beyond that, I’m trying to figure out what I’m
  going to do when I grow up. I haven’t sorted that out yet but I spend a lot of time
  in schools and classrooms still, talking to young children. As you know, I’ve had
  the good fortune to be able to write three children’s books with my youngest daughter
  and we’ve got to get on to book four.\nJH: I was going to ask; that was my next
  question.\nAP: We’ve got to get on to book four.\nJH: More work to be done.\nAP:
  More work to be done.\nJH: And Justice Page Middle School? I mean, it seems you
  spend time—I see pictures and things and you’re really engaged with the school.\nAP:
  I am engaged with the school. The school is magic. You know, sixth, seventh, eighth
  graders—they energize me still. They keep me going. And I also have four grandchildren
  that do the same thing.\nJH: Being a grandfather, a job in and of itself.\nAP: Yes.\nJH:
  Well, I think that’s a good place to close. Unless you have any other thoughts.
  We’ve had a good conversation so thanks for sharing your insights today. And thank
  you, I think in 25\nthinking about this conversation through the arc from beginning
  to end and the focus on the Minnesota Supreme Court, I want to and then I thank
  and we all want to thank you for your service on the Supreme Court, too.\nAP: Well,
  thank you for that, but I can’t articulate how much I loved serving on the court
  and being able to serve the people of this state. I can’t articulate how honored
  I am that the people of this state gave me the opportunity to do it and I don’t
  know—well, let me just back up. You know, one of the humbling things about serving
  is you’re there; you’re working on cases and you’re looking at cases from 1860,
  trying to figure out what the law is today because it’s grounded in something that
  took place back then. The idea that cases that I worked on when I was on the court
  will be used one hundred fifty, two hundred years from now, that the law will be
  grounded in something that I was a part of during my tenure, it’s almost overwhelming.\nJH:
  It’s an awesome thought.\nAP: I just hope that I didn’t goof it up so that hopefully
  what I did; what we did when I was on the court will make their jobs easier.\nJH:
  Sure. A good note to end on.\nAP: Thank you.\nJH: Thank you, appreciate it. It was
  good to talk to you Justice Page.\nAP: Good to see you, Jeff.\nEnd of Recording\n02:00:18

  00:01:07.570\nSure. So I wonder if you\ncould just start us off by\n\n27\n00:01:07.570
  --> 00:01:08.690\ntalking a little bit\n\n28\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.140\nabout
  your family and\nwhere you grew up.\n\n29\n00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.629\nWas born
  in C Kenton, Ohio.\n\n30\n00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.309\nI was the fourth\nof four
  children.\n\n31\n00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:25.949\nMy mother was a worked as an\nattendant
  in a country club.\n\n32\n00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:30.189\nAnd my father various jobs\n\n33\n00:01:30.189
  --> 00:01:37.530\nfrom operating jukeboxes to\n\n34\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.630\nrunning
  a bar, that\nsort of thing.\n\n35\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.849\nI''d say I was
  the fourth\nof four children.\n\n36\n00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.950\nTwo sisters
  and a brother.\n\n37\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.670\nOkay.\n\n38\n00:01:51.670 -->
  00:02:02.589\nU My childhood was pretty\nhappy one, pretty uneventful.\n\n39\n00:02:02.589
  --> 00:02:09.799\nNot Not much exciting\nto talk about.\n\n40\n00:02:09.920 -->
  00:02:14.280\nWe weren''t the\nwealthiest of families,\n\n41\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.619\nbut
  we weren''t the post either.\n\n42\n00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:21.419\nMy parents neither
  one\n\n43\n00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:26.260\nhad the opportunity to go to\nschool beyond
  high school,\n\n44\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.999\nand they emphasized for me\nand
  my brother and my sisters\n\n45\n00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.560\nthe importance of
  education\n\n46\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.399\nand the importance of\nbeing good
  citizens.\n\n47\n00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.259\nAnd in their own way,\n\n48\n00:02:43.259
  --> 00:02:47.499\nsomething that I\nthink stuck with me.\n\n49\n00:02:47.499 -->
  00:02:49.799\nThey talked about and\n\n50\n00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.859\nemphasized
  the importance\nof seeking excellence.\n\n51\n00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.459\nNow
  they didn''t say it that way.\n\n52\n00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.679\nRight. But I
  think\n\n53\n00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.619\nthat''s the bottom line of\nwhat they
  were talking about.\n\n54\n00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:08.399\nThey would always and
  I can\nhear them now telling me,\n\n55\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.499\nwhatever
  you do in life,\n\n56\n00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:12.819\ndo it as well as you can.\n\n57\n00:03:12.819
  --> 00:03:16.500\nMm. If you''re going to\nbe a garbage collector,\n\n58\n00:03:16.500
  --> 00:03:19.899\nbe the best garbage\ncollector. You can be.\n\n59\n00:03:19.899
  --> 00:03:23.380\nIf you''re going to be a doctor,\n\n60\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.599\nbe
  the best doctor you can be.\n\n61\n00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.400\nNot as good as
  the next\ndoctor or garbage collector,\n\n62\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.979\nbut
  the best one you can be.\n\n63\n00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:38.399\nRight. And that''s
  something\n\n64\n00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:43.239\nthat they preached and I think,\n\n65\n00:03:43.239
  --> 00:03:44.840\nhas served me well over time.\n\n66\n00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.289\nYeah.
  I think I recall\nyou talking about,\n\n67\n00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.349\nyou know,
  at a pretty young age,\n\n68\n00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.869\nhaving some experiences\nor
  influences that sort\n\n69\n00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.929\nof made you think that\nyou
  might want to be\n\n70\n00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.530\na lawyer someday. Talk\nabout
  that a little bit.\n\n71\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.069\nI very early on,\n\n72\n00:04:05.069
  --> 00:04:08.769\num when, you know,\n\n73\n00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.309\nwhen
  I was eight, nine,\n\n74\n00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.830\n10-years-old, people would
  ask\n\n75\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.749\nme what I wanted to\ndo when I grew up.\n\n76\n00:04:13.749
  --> 00:04:16.350\nAnd I would say I\nwanted to be a lawyer.\n\n77\n00:04:16.350
  --> 00:04:19.709\nAnd, you know, what\n8-year-old knows?\n\n78\n00:04:19.709 -->
  00:04:23.070\nRight. Really what they want\nto do when they grow up.\n\n79\n00:04:23.070
  --> 00:04:26.589\nBut as I noted,\n\n80\n00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:28.689\nI grew up
  in Kenton, Ohio.\n\n81\n00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:34.769\nIt was a town built on heavy\nindustry,
  primarily steel.\n\n82\n00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:37.030\nAnd I had an uncle who\n\n83\n00:04:37.030
  --> 00:04:40.079\nspent 40 years working\nin the steel Mill.\n\n84\n00:04:40.079
  --> 00:04:43.589\nAnd I knew intuitively\n\n85\n00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:47.470\nthat
  that''s not something\nthat I wanted to do. Yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.730\nI
  mean, nothing wrong with\nworking in steel mills,\n\n87\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.629\nbut
  from my 8-year-old eyes,\n\n88\n00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.150\nthe work was dirty.\n\n89\n00:04:58.150
  --> 00:05:05.370\nIt was hard. It was\ndangerous and repetitious.\n\n90\n00:05:05.370
  --> 00:05:11.130\nAnd somehow I knew that that\ndidn''t fit me. I''d heard\n\n91\n00:05:11.190
  --> 00:05:18.890\nStories about lawyers,\nthat you know,\n\n92\n00:05:18.890 -->
  00:05:21.289\nfrom not that I\nknew any lawyers,\n\n93\n00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.189\nthat
  had any lawyers\nin my family\n\n94\n00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.289\nor my family
  really\nknew any lawyers.\n\n95\n00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.690\nYeah. But the impression
  in\n\n96\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.030\nthe community I grew up\n\n97\n00:05:32.030
  --> 00:05:34.689\nwas that lawyers\ndidn''t work too hard,\n\n98\n00:05:34.689 -->
  00:05:36.490\nmade lots of money,\n\n99\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.229\ndrove big
  fancy cars,\n\n100\n00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.410\nlived in big houses,\n\n101\n00:05:39.410
  --> 00:05:42.904\nand went out and played golf\nevery Wednesday afternoon.\n\n102\n00:05:42.904
  --> 00:05:44.899\nWell, for the 8-year-old mind,\n\n103\n00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:50.640\nbalancing
  fancy cars and\ndangerous and dirty work.\n\n104\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.699\nWhich
  do I choose?\nWhich do I choose?\n\n105\n00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.719\nIt becomes
  real simple.\n\n106\n00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.759\nI also grew up watching\nPerry
  Mason. Mm hmm.\n\n107\n00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.439\nAnd so I had a very\nrudimentary
  sense\n\n108\n00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.379\nof what the law is about\nfrom that
  television show.\n\n109\n00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:16.999\nAnd finally, something that,\ninfluenced
  me greatly.\n\n110\n00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:18.600\nYou have to remember that I grew\n\n111\n00:06:18.600
  --> 00:06:23.239\nup I was 8-year-old,\n8-years-old in 1954?\n\n112\n00:06:23.239
  --> 00:06:28.060\nRight. At the time,\n\n113\n00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:35.539\nour
  country was grounded in\nstate sponsored segregation.\n\n114\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.669\nAnd
  In 1954,\n\n115\n00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.029\nthe Supreme Court decided\n\n116\n00:06:42.029
  --> 00:06:44.249\nBrown versus the\nBoard of Education.\n\n117\n00:06:44.249 -->
  00:06:46.890\nI can remember reading\n\n118\n00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.810\nnewspaper
  stories about\nhearing people talk about it.\n\n119\n00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.249\nAnd
  again, not that I\nunderstood it fully,\n\n120\n00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:01.350\nbut
  it gave me a sense\nof the power that\n\n121\n00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.030\nthe
  law has that if\n\n122\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.790\nthe courts through the law\n\n123\n00:07:10.790
  --> 00:07:15.429\ncould essentially\nsound the death knell\n\n124\n00:07:15.429
  --> 00:07:19.790\nfor state sponsored segregation.\n\n125\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:29.329\nIt
  had the power to change\nhow people treat one another.\n\n126\n00:07:29.329 -->
  00:07:31.990\nYeah. And that''s something\n\n127\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.930\nthat
  I grew up and\nhad an interest in.\n\n128\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.550\nAs I got
  older,\n\n129\n00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.830\nI was disabused of\n\n130\n00:07:42.830
  --> 00:07:45.990\nthe idea that lawyers\ndidn''t work hard.\n\n131\n00:07:47.080
  --> 00:07:51.020\nOr that they necessarily\nmade lots and lots of money.\n\n132\n00:07:51.020
  --> 00:07:55.299\nRight. But I also developed\n\n133\n00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:57.360\nthe
  sense that the law\n\n134\n00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.700\nwas about solving problems\nand
  helping people.\n\n135\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.900\nYeah. And that''s also something\nthat
  resonated with me.\n\n136\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.839\nYeah.\n\n137\n00:08:08.839
  --> 00:08:15.260\nAnd so That was\n\n138\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.780\nsort of
  my dream for the future\n\n139\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.560\nand never lost it,\nnever
  lost it.\n\n140\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.899\nAnd again, you know,\n\n141\n00:08:25.899
  --> 00:08:28.660\n1954, there was Brown.\n\n142\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.979\nRight.
  Along the way,\n\n143\n00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:39.020\nthere were there\nwas Little
  Rock.\n\n144\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.419\nThere was Birmingham, there\n\n145\n00:08:42.419
  --> 00:08:47.480\nwere full blown Civil\nRights movement,\n\n146\n00:08:47.480 -->
  00:08:51.919\nan effort to change\n\n147\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.340\nor address
  issues\nof race in ways\n\n148\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.040\nthat hadn''t been\nsuccessful
  in the past?\n\n149\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:07.339\nYeah. And I''m sure that\n\n150\n00:09:07.339
  --> 00:09:11.139\nall had some bearing\non my sense of\n\n151\n00:09:11.139 -->
  00:09:12.579\nwhat the law is about and\n\n152\n00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:15.360\nwhat
  could be done with the law.\n\n153\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.889\nYeah. You know,\n\n154\n00:09:18.889
  --> 00:09:21.249\nthinking about Brown\nB board specifically,\n\n155\n00:09:21.249
  --> 00:09:23.690\nI mean, what was Canton\n\n156\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.570\nlike
  growing up sort of in\nterms of a racial makeup,\n\n157\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.429\nwas
  it a pretty segregated\nin fact city? Absolutely.\n\n158\n00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:33.730\nYeah.
  Absolutely. You knew\nwhere you belonged and didn''t\n\n159\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:40.610\nbelong
  and it''s interesting.\n\n160\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.829\nI didn''t grow up\nin
  an area where\n\n161\n00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:47.330\nthe segregation was race\nspun
  or was state sponsored.\n\n162\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.910\nRight. But in practical
  effect,\n\n163\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.890\nit might as well have been.\n\n164\n00:09:54.550
  --> 00:09:59.589\nSo let''s talk briefly about\nCentral Catholic High school,\n\n165\n00:09:59.589
  --> 00:10:03.190\nkind of your high school\nexperience in Canton,\n\n166\n00:10:03.190
  --> 00:10:05.529\nwas it the plan\nfor you to kind of\n\n167\n00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:07.349\nattend
  Central Catholic because\n\n168\n00:10:07.349 --> 00:10:09.189\nyour family did
  or was\nit football related\n\n169\n00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:11.590\nor what was the
  kind of\nthe trajectory there?\n\n170\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.870\nWell, I our
  family\n\n171\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.650\nmoved from Canton out\ninto the countryside.\n\n172\n00:10:19.650
  --> 00:10:21.089\nOkay.\n\n173\n00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:25.669\nWith an East Canton\nOhio
  address,\n\n174\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.549\nbecause my parents felt that\n\n175\n00:10:31.600
  --> 00:10:36.399\nThe education available in\n\n176\n00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:40.479\nthe
  Canton City Schools wasn''t\nwhat they wanted for us.\n\n177\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.399\nAnd
  my two older sisters,\n\n178\n00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:47.739\ninterestingly, didn''t
  decide to\n\n179\n00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:49.559\ngo to school in East C Kenton.\n\n180\n00:10:49.559
  --> 00:10:54.359\nThey and along with my\nparents concluded that\n\n181\n00:10:54.359
  --> 00:10:55.759\nKenton Central Catholic had\n\n182\n00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:00.299\nthe
  best possible education\nMm for our circumstances.\n\n183\n00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:05.020\nAnd
  so they ended up going\nto Central Catholic.\n\n184\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.259\nOkay.\n\n185\n00:11:06.300
  --> 00:11:13.159\nAnd then my brother who\nwas ahead of me, he went.\n\n186\n00:11:13.159
  --> 00:11:17.520\nAnd so I was destined to follow.\n\n187\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:27.019\nAnd
  I before I got\nto high school.\n\n188\n00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:31.780\nI hadn''t
  really I wasn''t much\nof an athlete and as a kid.\n\n189\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.199\nI
  wasn''t one of those kids\nthat everybody sort of\n\n190\n00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:38.880\nsought
  after to come\nand be on their team.\n\n191\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.100\nBut
  my brother went\nout for football,\n\n192\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.979\nand so
  when I got\nthere, I went out.\n\n193\n00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:50.119\nAnd as it
  turns out,\n\n194\n00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:52.989\nI evidently had some\naptitude
  for it.\n\n195\n00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:54.799\nI''ve heard you use that phrase,\n\n196\n00:11:54.799
  --> 00:11:56.459\nhave some aptitude\nfor it before, right?\n\n197\n00:11:56.459
  --> 00:12:00.239\nYeah. So in terms\nof high school,\n\n198\n00:12:00.239 --> 00:12:02.559\ndo
  you remember having an\nearly interest in sort of\n\n199\n00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.680\nthe
  lawn politics and\nthose sort of things\n\n200\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.359\nor
  were you still sort of\nnavigating and not quite sure?\n\n201\n00:12:07.359 -->
  00:12:10.219\nI think I was always\ninterested in Yeah.\n\n202\n00:12:10.219 -->
  00:12:14.779\nIn politics. From very early on.\n\n203\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.020\nBut
  only in the sense\n\n204\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.359\nof trying to figure out
  how\nit works to help people?\n\n205\n00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:28.000\nYeah. I never
  had much\n\n206\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.980\ninterested in politics\nfor politics
  sake.\n\n207\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.499\nAnd so when I got\nto high school,\n\n208\n00:12:39.499
  --> 00:12:42.799\nI mean, the courses\nI loved were,\n\n209\n00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:46.259\nyou
  know, back then,\nit was civics.\n\n210\n00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:48.879\nMm and government.\n\n211\n00:12:48.879
  --> 00:12:51.780\nYeah. Those kind of classes.\n\n212\n00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.119\nSo
  is there a point you\n\n213\n00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:58.259\nplay football at Central\nCatholic
  and Yes.\n\n214\n00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:02.099\nIs there a point\neven in high school,\n\n215\n00:13:02.099
  --> 00:13:07.439\nwhere you think that\nfootball could be used as\n\n216\n00:13:07.439
  --> 00:13:12.959\na as a way to pursue\nan education,\n\n217\n00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:17.079\nor
  does that realization not\nhappen until a bit later?\n\n218\n00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:24.320\nYou
  know, Growing up in Canton,\n\n219\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:33.240\nthere was this
  conflict between\nathletics and academics.\n\n220\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:43.039\nYeah.
  There was a very strong\nemphasis on athletics,\n\n221\n00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:47.060\nparticularly
  in the African\nAmerican community.\n\n222\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.659\nAnd so
  I''m growing up,\n\n223\n00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:55.299\nnot much interested\nin
  football and\n\n224\n00:13:55.299 --> 00:14:01.119\nseeing an inordinate\nnumber
  of young men\n\n225\n00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:08.640\nwho had guess what\n\n226\n00:14:08.640
  --> 00:14:11.299\nyou would call Stellar High\nSchool football careers?\n\n227\n00:14:11.299
  --> 00:14:14.959\nYeah. Go off to college for\ntwo, three, four years,\n\n228\n00:14:14.959
  --> 00:14:17.939\ncome back to Canton,\nhang out and ended\n\n229\n00:14:17.939
  --> 00:14:19.380\nup hanging out on\nthe street corner\n\n230\n00:14:19.380 -->
  00:14:21.219\nunemployed and unemployable.\n\n231\n00:14:21.219 --> 00:14:24.699\nAnd,
  you know, I that\ndidn''t make sense to me.\n\n232\n00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:28.239\nYeah.
  I couldn''t figure out.\n\n233\n00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:31.499\nAnd this was before
  I\nstarted playing football.\n\n234\n00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:32.319\nYeah.\n\n235\n00:14:32.319
  --> 00:14:41.519\nUm then I started\nplaying as I say,\n\n236\n00:14:41.519 -->
  00:14:44.839\nmore by accident than by design.\n\n237\n00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:51.239\nAnd
  I loved playing,\n\n238\n00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:54.839\nbut I was just playing\nfootball
  because I loved it,\n\n239\n00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:57.479\nnot for any other purpose.\n\n240\n00:14:57.479
  --> 00:15:06.299\nYeah. By the time\nI was a you know,\n\n241\n00:15:06.940 -->
  00:15:12.639\nSophomore junior, there was\n\n242\n00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:14.559\ntalk
  that I might be able to\n\n243\n00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:18.899\nobtain an athletic
  scholarship.\n\n244\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.929\nAnd so I suppose that\naround
  that time,\n\n245\n00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:29.609\nI started thinking about\nit,
  it could be used.\n\n246\n00:15:29.609 --> 00:15:38.370\nRight. One of the in hindsight,\n\n247\n00:15:38.370
  --> 00:15:44.949\none of the disappointments\nwhen I look back is\n\n248\n00:15:44.949
  --> 00:15:54.629\nthat while I did okay as\na student in high school,\n\n249\n00:15:56.470
  --> 00:16:01.429\nDid okay as a student\n\n250\n00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:04.589\nin
  elementary and\njunior high school.\n\n251\n00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.970\nI did
  it the easy way.\n\n252\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:14.949\nI I didn''t essentially,\n\n253\n00:16:14.949
  --> 00:16:18.210\nI didn''t wasn''t there\nto learn how to learn.\n\n254\n00:16:18.210
  --> 00:16:20.089\nI I wasn''t there to do the work.\n\n255\n00:16:20.089 --> 00:16:25.289\nAnd
  I could do the work\nwithout learning how to learn?\n\n256\n00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:26.829\nYeah.
  I could, you know,\n\n257\n00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:28.609\nanswer the questions and\n\n258\n00:16:28.609
  --> 00:16:31.729\nwork through the math\nproblems and all of that.\n\n259\n00:16:31.729
  --> 00:16:35.739\nBut you simply because you\n\n260\n00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:37.940\ncan
  do the work doesn''t\n\n261\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.680\nmean that you''re really\nlearning
  a whole lot.\n\n262\n00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.840\nMm. And I think the\nimportant
  part of what goes\n\n263\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.859\non in schools in\n\n264\n00:16:45.859
  --> 00:16:48.619\nthe education process is\nlearning how to learn.\n\n265\n00:16:48.619
  --> 00:16:49.679\nYeah.\n\n266\n00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:54.779\nAnd so I sort of
  missed that.\n\n267\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.099\nAnd so as in high school,\n\n268\n00:17:01.099
  --> 00:17:04.100\nthe work got more difficult.\n\n269\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.099\nI
  still, you know,\n\n270\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.239\nthrive to some degree.\n\n271\n00:17:13.239
  --> 00:17:19.079\nBut had I learned how\nto learn early on,\n\n272\n00:17:19.600
  --> 00:17:23.979\nI think I mean, I was\nfocused on going to school\n\n273\n00:17:23.979
  --> 00:17:25.899\nbeyond high school\nbecause that was\n\n274\n00:17:25.899 -->
  00:17:29.079\nthe emphasis my parents placed.\n\n275\n00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:36.639\nBut
  if I had\n\n276\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.040\nsort of made that connection\n\n277\n00:17:43.040
  --> 00:17:46.119\nto learning how to\nlearn early on.\n\n278\n00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:52.800\nI
  might have had a little\nmore success academically.\n\n279\n00:17:53.400 --> 00:18:01.459\nNo
  I don''t focus on that\nso much because, you know,\n\n280\n00:18:01.459 --> 00:18:05.899\nI
  could have been done\nbetter in school,\n\n281\n00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:09.279\nbut
  I would have been better\nprepared for the future.\n\n282\n00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:15.759\nRight.
  As it turned out,\n\n283\n00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:18.399\nand I did okay. Yeah.\n\n284\n00:18:18.399
  --> 00:18:22.879\nAnd ended up receiving a number\n\n285\n00:18:22.879 --> 00:18:27.399\nof
  scholarship offers,\nathletic scholarship offers.\n\n286\n00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:34.900\nI
  think had I had that Had\nI learned how to learn,\n\n287\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.539\nthere
  might have been some\nacademic scholarships.\n\n288\n00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:39.600\nYeah.
  In that Q also.\n\n289\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.939\nRight. Which gives\nyou choices,
  right?\n\n290\n00:18:44.939 --> 00:18:48.899\nSure. But I had\n\n291\n00:18:48.899
  --> 00:18:53.200\nthe opportunity to choose among\nsome pretty good schools,\n\n292\n00:18:53.200
  --> 00:18:58.279\nand ultimately selected the\nUniversity of Notre Dame.\n\n293\n00:18:58.279
  --> 00:19:01.400\nSo it''s a good\ntransition to Notre Dame\n\n294\n00:19:01.400
  --> 00:19:04.579\nand talk a little bit about\nyour time in college.\n\n295\n00:19:04.579
  --> 00:19:07.200\nWhy Notre Dame?\n\n296\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.229\nPrimarily
  because of\n\n297\n00:19:12.229 --> 00:19:18.829\nits academic reputation\nand because
  of\n\n298\n00:19:18.829 --> 00:19:25.709\nits reputation in terms\n\n299\n00:19:25.709
  --> 00:19:32.410\nof how it interacted\nwith its alumni.\n\n300\n00:19:34.210 -->
  00:19:39.590\nThey have an incredible\n\n301\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.169\nhad
  then and continue to\n\n302\n00:19:41.169 --> 00:19:44.429\nhave an incredible\nalumni
  association.\n\n303\n00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:53.569\nYeah, which provides any\nnumber
  of benefits to\n\n304\n00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:58.349\npeople who graduate\nfrom
  there in terms\n\n305\n00:19:58.349 --> 00:20:04.210\nof employment opportunities\nand
  other kinds of support.\n\n306\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.159\nAnd um You know,\n\n307\n00:20:09.159
  --> 00:20:12.479\nas they say that the schools\nthat I was choosing from,\n\n308\n00:20:12.479
  --> 00:20:13.920\nthey were all good schools.\n\n309\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.120\nI
  mean, it was Purdue,\n\n310\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.360\nit was Michigan state,\n\n311\n00:20:16.360
  --> 00:20:23.680\nit was Michigan\nMinnesota Ohio state.\n\n312\n00:20:23.680 -->
  00:20:28.100\nSo it wasn''t like they didn''t\n\n313\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.800\nhave
  some of the things that\nNotre Dame had to offer.\n\n314\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.359\nBut
  it It was it\nwas sort of looking\n\n315\n00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:45.400\nbeyond
  the college years.\n\n316\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:52.419\nThat was, I think, ultimately\nthe
  deciding factor.\n\n317\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:58.139\nThat coupled with, I\nhad
  no interest in\n\n318\n00:20:58.139 --> 00:21:02.900\ngoing to Ohio State.\nWho
  knows why?\n\n319\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.939\nAnd\n\n320\n00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:17.089\nNotre
  Dame also had this\nreputation football wise.\n\n321\n00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:24.569\nSure.
  That at least at the time,\n\n322\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:30.869\nwas about as good
  as it.\n\n323\n00:21:30.869 --> 00:21:39.579\nYeah. I to to be a\nBlack kid from
  Canton,\n\n324\n00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:46.399\nOhio going to play a in the\nhouse
  that Newt Rockne built.\n\n325\n00:21:46.399 --> 00:21:53.200\nYeah. That''s sort
  of put\nstars in your eyes. For sure.\n\n326\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.739\nSo
  was that an exciting I mean,\n\n327\n00:21:55.739 --> 00:21:57.780\nexciting time,
  I would\nsuspect, in a lot of ways,\n\n328\n00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.639\nwas it
  a nerve racking\ntime transitioning\n\n329\n00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:01.360\nfrom
  Canton and leaving home\n\n330\n00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.759\nor It was it was
  an exciting\ntime, a very difficult time.\n\n331\n00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:12.059\nI
  you know, just going\nback to Central Catholic.\n\n332\n00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:19.479\nSure.
  I was one of two,\n\n333\n00:22:19.479 --> 00:22:21.719\nI think, maybe three,\n\n334\n00:22:21.719
  --> 00:22:27.699\nmaybe four African American\nkids in my graduating class.\n\n335\n00:22:29.260
  --> 00:22:31.719\nGoing off to Notre Dame,\n\n336\n00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:34.359\nit
  was going to be, you know,\n\n337\n00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:37.339\nthere were a few
  more,\nbut not many more.\n\n338\n00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:48.179\nRight. So and it
  was at a time,\n\n339\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.580\nthat sort of our\nnational
  economy\n\n340\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.500\nwas in sort of a\ndownward spiral.\n\n341\n00:22:58.500
  --> 00:23:02.159\nMm. And Notre Dame is,\n\n342\n00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.980\nyou
  know, is in\nSouth Bend, Indiana.\n\n343\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.479\nAnd they
  were also a heavy\nindustry town and one of\n\n344\n00:23:10.479 --> 00:23:17.209\nthe
  One of the main employers\nthere was Stuter Baker,\n\n345\n00:23:17.209 --> 00:23:19.449\nthe
  auto manufacturer. Yeah.\n\n346\n00:23:19.449 --> 00:23:21.589\nAnd they went out
  of\n\n347\n00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:24.670\nbusiness just about\nthe time I got there.\n\n348\n00:23:25.310
  --> 00:23:29.509\nIt was my first time\naway from home, really.\n\n349\n00:23:29.509
  --> 00:23:32.670\nI then a kid who''d\ngone off to camp\n\n350\n00:23:32.670 -->
  00:23:36.450\nand spent any time\naway from home.\n\n351\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.610\nSo
  it was all new to me. Mm hmm.\n\n352\n00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:46.510\nU And it was
  also,\n\n353\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.569\nyou know, the first\ntime that I''d
  really\n\n354\n00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:55.829\nbeen put in a position where\nI''m
  responsible for myself.\n\n355\n00:23:55.829 --> 00:23:58.729\nAs every kid who
  goes\noff the school is.\n\n356\n00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:00.310\nThat''s a big change.\n\n357\n00:24:00.310
  --> 00:24:05.830\nA huge change. And\nso it was difficult.\n\n358\n00:24:05.830
  --> 00:24:12.549\nAnd one of the things\nI didn''t realize was,\n\n359\n00:24:17.240
  --> 00:24:21.059\nNotre Dame was not\n\n360\n00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:26.479\nthe
  most progressive\nplace to go to school.\n\n361\n00:24:26.479 --> 00:24:30.439\nAnd
  so that was\n\n362\n00:24:30.439 --> 00:24:33.439\nsomething that was a\nlittle
  different for me,\n\n363\n00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:35.539\nand having to adjust to
  that.\n\n364\n00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:38.019\nYeah. I think it was there\n\n365\n00:24:38.019
  --> 00:24:40.479\nwere some difficult transitions.\n\n366\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.620\nI
  was speaking to\nkind of the economy\n\n367\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.839\nin a
  downturn, thinking\nabout that time,\n\n368\n00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:49.600\ntoo,
  and in a lot of ways,\n\n369\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.079\nthe Civil Rights Movement\nis
  sort of at its apex,\n\n370\n00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:53.779\nand the Civil Right,\n\n371\n00:24:53.779
  --> 00:24:55.180\nyou know, the Voting Rights Act.\n\n372\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.719\nAnd
  so was that a part of\n\n373\n00:24:56.719 --> 00:24:59.019\nthe kind of the\ncampus
  conversation,\n\n374\n00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:02.519\nor do you recall\nanything
  about that?\n\n375\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.560\nNot a little bit, but not much.\n\n376\n00:25:07.560
  --> 00:25:15.870\nYou know, and Being on\nthe football team there,\n\n377\n00:25:15.870
  --> 00:25:18.630\nyou really weren''t necessarily\n\n378\n00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.569\nthat
  much a part of the\ncampus conversation.\n\n379\n00:25:21.569 --> 00:25:24.430\nEven
  though you were you lived\n\n380\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.709\nin the dorms with
  everybody\nelse and went to Yeah,\n\n381\n00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:29.230\nmeals with
  everybody else\n\n382\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:35.070\nand went to classes\nwith
  everybody else.\n\n383\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:41.030\nYour focal point was football.\n\n384\n00:25:41.030
  --> 00:25:47.350\nAnd so you weren''t\nreally much connected.\n\n385\n00:25:50.460
  --> 00:25:53.679\nIt was really kind of\nan interesting time in\n\n386\n00:25:53.679
  --> 00:25:56.799\nthat respect because, I mean,\n\n387\n00:25:56.799 --> 00:26:00.599\nthe
  civil rights movement\n\n388\n00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:06.999\nwas going through some\nchallenging
  times.\n\n389\n00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:10.719\nYeah. About the same time\n\n390\n00:26:10.719
  --> 00:26:17.159\nthe Vietnam War protest started.\n\n391\n00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:19.819\nMm
  hm. And so it''s sort of like\n\n392\n00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:24.279\nyou''re in
  this bubble\nlooking out on all of this.\n\n393\n00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:26.379\nUm\n\n394\n00:26:30.040
  --> 00:26:33.499\nAnd not having a direct\nconnection to it,\n\n395\n00:26:33.499
  --> 00:26:35.659\nbut having the opportunity\nto at least see it.\n\n396\n00:26:35.659
  --> 00:26:40.259\nYeah. And think about\nit, but not engage.\n\n397\n00:26:40.259
  --> 00:26:42.179\nWell, it''s interesting\nyou mentioned that,\n\n398\n00:26:42.179
  --> 00:26:43.700\nbecause if you yeah,\n\n399\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.040\nthinking
  about it, the\nfocus on football,\n\n400\n00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.460\nand you''re
  a young kid\nstill in transitioning,\n\n401\n00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.509\nso maybe
  not a lot of capacity\n\n402\n00:26:53.509 --> 00:26:55.429\nfor a lot of other
  stuff\n\n403\n00:26:55.429 --> 00:26:58.630\nthat''s the focus\nin a lot of ways.\n\n404\n00:26:58.710
  --> 00:27:02.669\nEven if you had the instinct,\n\n405\n00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:05.549\nhm,
  they took up your time.\n\n406\n00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:07.689\nYeah. And your energy,\n\n407\n00:27:07.689
  --> 00:27:10.810\nboth physical and emotional.\n\n408\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.069\nYeah.\n\n409\n00:27:19.270
  --> 00:27:23.970\nAnd so it was in that respect,\n\n410\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.830\nI
  missed out on a lot.\n\n411\n00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:36.849\nBut, you know, I I can''t\nremember
  the precise timing.\n\n412\n00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:41.729\nBut my freshman year,\n\n413\n00:27:41.729
  --> 00:27:44.069\nthe start of my freshman year,\n\n414\n00:27:44.069 --> 00:27:47.970\nwent
  to football training camp\n\n415\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.209\na couple of weeks\nbefore
  school started.\n\n416\n00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:54.869\nAnd I think we got there\neither
  just before or just\n\n417\n00:27:54.869 --> 00:28:00.110\nafter the March in Washington.\n\n418\n00:28:01.590
  --> 00:28:07.009\nI think school had started\nby the time the bombing at\n\n419\n00:28:07.009
  --> 00:28:12.689\nthe 16th Street Baptist Church\noccurred in Birmingham.\n\n420\n00:28:12.689
  --> 00:28:16.909\nAnd so you had all of\nthese things going on.\n\n421\n00:28:19.590
  --> 00:28:23.089\nAs I noted that you''re sort\nof watching from afar.\n\n422\n00:28:23.089
  --> 00:28:30.369\nYeah. And understanding\nthat they affect you,\n\n423\n00:28:30.369
  --> 00:28:34.090\nbut sort of not directly?\n\n424\n00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.249\nFeeling
  removed a little bit.\n\n425\n00:28:36.249 --> 00:28:46.510\nYeah. While the focus
  on\nfootball bore some fruit.\n\n426\n00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.109\nNational Championship\nwas
  it your senior year?\n\n427\n00:28:50.109 --> 00:28:54.230\nYes. I I should note.\n\n428\n00:28:56.030
  --> 00:28:59.069\nI think it was in the\n\n429\n00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.879\nI
  think it was still while I was\n\n430\n00:29:05.879 --> 00:29:10.000\nthere or or
  he was\nplanning to come.\n\n431\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.379\nOne of our speakers,\n\n432\n00:29:12.379
  --> 00:29:14.579\none of the people who\nwas coming to campus to\n\n433\n00:29:14.579
  --> 00:29:16.739\nspeak with George Wallace.\n\n434\n00:29:16.739 --> 00:29:21.100\nAh.
  That got people engaged.\n\n435\n00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.320\nI got some attention.\nThat
  got some attention.\n\n436\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.320\nDid did he come?\n\n437\n00:29:26.320
  --> 00:29:30.079\nDo you remember I''m\n\n438\n00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:32.059\npretty
  sure it was while\nI was still there.\n\n439\n00:29:32.059 --> 00:29:36.999\nInteresting.
  Needless to\nsay I didn''t attend. Yeah.\n\n440\n00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:47.010\nProbably
  not a\nregret. No. So you''re\n\n441\n00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.810\ndrafted by
  the Vikings\n\n442\n00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.830\nkind of at the close of\nyour
  career at Notre Dame.\n\n443\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.549\nAnd kind of, you know,\nmoving
  ahead a little bit,\n\n444\n00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:59.090\nthere''s obviously lots
  to talk\n\n445\n00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.149\nabout that we could\ntalk about with
  respect\n\n446\n00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:06.569\nto your professional career\nin the
  NFL and It happened.\n\n447\n00:30:06.569 --> 00:30:07.829\nIt happened. It happened.\n\n448\n00:30:07.829
  --> 00:30:09.749\nYou''ve talked about\na little bit, right?\n\n449\n00:30:09.749
  --> 00:30:14.409\nBut I want to focus\non just what kind of\n\n450\n00:30:14.409
  --> 00:30:16.709\none unique aspect that\nI was interested about\n\n451\n00:30:16.709
  --> 00:30:20.549\nwas your participation in\nthe NFL Players Association.\n\n452\n00:30:21.750
  --> 00:30:24.929\nSo it''s something\nthat I, you know,\n\n453\n00:30:24.929 -->
  00:30:26.750\nI know you''ve talked\nabout before,\n\n454\n00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.330\nbut
  I don''t you don''t\nhear it quite as often,\n\n455\n00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.589\ntoo.
  So I was just curious.\n\n456\n00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.550\nYou''re playing with
  the Vikings.\n\n457\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.929\nHow do you get involved in\nthe
  players association\n\n458\n00:30:35.929 --> 00:30:38.010\nand what sort of your
  role?\n\n459\n00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:45.149\nWell, the there had\n\n460\n00:30:45.149
  --> 00:30:53.109\nbeen This is a long,\ncomplicated story. Okay.\n\n461\n00:30:53.109
  --> 00:30:56.729\nLong too complicated for\nhere. It''s a big question.\n\n462\n00:30:57.610
  --> 00:31:01.530\nThere had been various efforts\n\n463\n00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:08.010\non
  the part of players\nto organize before 1968.\n\n464\n00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:16.229\n1960
  of the league\n\n465\n00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.509\nis confronted with\nanother
  football league,\n\n466\n00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:22.769\nthe American Football League.\n\n467\n00:31:22.769
  --> 00:31:27.930\nRight. In 1966,\n\n468\n00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.749\nthose two
  leagues merge\n\n469\n00:31:31.749 --> 00:31:35.210\nwith the merger\ntaking place
  in 268.\n\n470\n00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:40.449\nIn 198, the players from\n\n471\n00:31:40.449
  --> 00:31:42.209\nboth leagues come together\n\n472\n00:31:42.209 --> 00:31:43.210\nand
  form\n\n473\n00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.409\nthe National Football\nLeague Players
  Association.\n\n474\n00:31:46.409 --> 00:31:50.829\nThat was my second year\nin
  the league? Right.\n\n475\n00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:59.930\nAnd somehow I either\n\n476\n00:31:59.930
  --> 00:32:05.230\nvolunteered or agreed to serve\nas player representative.\n\n477\n00:32:06.710
  --> 00:32:12.130\nAnd so I that''s how\nI got involved.\n\n478\n00:32:12.130 -->
  00:32:16.229\nYeah. And Growing up in Canton,\n\n479\n00:32:16.229 --> 00:32:18.149\nI
  was used to\n\n480\n00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:20.649\norganized labor and had\n\n481\n00:32:20.649
  --> 00:32:23.309\na sort of a sense of\nwhat it was about.\n\n482\n00:32:23.309
  --> 00:32:33.879\nAnd The other piece of\nit was that the reason\n\n483\n00:32:33.879
  --> 00:32:36.219\nplayers wanted to come together\n\n484\n00:32:36.219 --> 00:32:46.160\nto
  form a union\nwas because well,\n\n485\n00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.119\nthere are
  a whole host of\nthem, not the least of\n\n486\n00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:50.259\nwhich
  is players essentially had\n\n487\n00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:58.430\nno rights in terms
  of\nwhere they could play?\n\n488\n00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:03.190\nYeah. Very little
  ability\n\n489\n00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.789\nto impact how much\nthey were paid.\n\n490\n00:33:06.789
  --> 00:33:11.610\nAnd then there were all these\n\n491\n00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.289\nwhat
  I will call\nsilly little rules\n\n492\n00:33:16.289 --> 00:33:25.109\nthat were
  imposed I\n\n493\n00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:28.409\nsuppose for as a\nmatter of control.\n\n494\n00:33:28.409
  --> 00:33:32.089\nThat''s all I can\nthink of. Things like\n\n495\n00:33:34.170
  --> 00:33:39.050\nyou can''t have a\nbeard or a mustache.\n\n496\n00:33:39.050 -->
  00:33:40.389\nI guess you could\nhave a mustache,\n\n497\n00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:42.410\nbut
  you couldn''t have a beard.\n\n498\n00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:53.189\nThings you know,\n\n499\n00:33:53.189
  --> 00:33:57.110\nyou have to be at every meal,\n\n500\n00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.269\nwhether
  you eat or not\nwant to eat or not.\n\n501\n00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:05.650\nYou have
  to you can''t have\na telephone in your room.\n\n502\n00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.049\nAnd
  this was before,\n\n503\n00:34:08.049 --> 00:34:11.869\nyou know, mobile phone.\n\n504\n00:34:11.869
  --> 00:34:14.329\nRight. But you\ncouldn''t, you know,\n\n505\n00:34:14.329 -->
  00:34:16.349\nhave the telephone\ncompany and put\n\n506\n00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:18.849\na
  phone into your room\nduring training camp.\n\n507\n00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:22.209\nI
  mean, though they''re just\na couple that come to mind.\n\n508\n00:34:22.209 -->
  00:34:28.769\nSure. And so there were\n\n509\n00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:34.930\nreally
  Lots of lots\n\n510\n00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:39.150\nof limitations on a player''s\nability
  to be themselves.\n\n511\n00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.189\nYeah.\n\n512\n00:34:40.189
  --> 00:34:44.569\nAnd players wanted\nto change that?\n\n513\n00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:52.910\nAnd
  obviously, the ability\nto choose where you worked,\n\n514\n00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.899\nwould
  have an impact on\nhow much you were paid?\n\n515\n00:34:57.899 --> 00:35:06.679\nUh
  huh. And so I think for me,\n\n516\n00:35:06.679 --> 00:35:08.460\nat least in the
  beginning,\n\n517\n00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.379\nit was sort of all of\n\n518\n00:35:10.379
  --> 00:35:13.360\nthose little controls\nthat just drove me crazy.\n\n519\n00:35:13.360
  --> 00:35:19.769\nYeah. Um, that got me involved.\n\n520\n00:35:19.769 --> 00:35:24.449\nAnd,
  you know, once you can''t\nget just a little bit wet.\n\n521\n00:35:24.449 --> 00:35:26.489\nOnce
  you''re in the\npool, you get.\n\n522\n00:35:26.489 --> 00:35:28.569\nRight. All
  wet.\n\n523\n00:35:28.569 --> 00:35:30.989\nDid you enjoy it?\nOh, I loved it.\n\n524\n00:35:30.989
  --> 00:35:34.030\nYeah. I loved it. It was\nfrustrating at times,\n\n525\n00:35:34.030
  --> 00:35:41.419\nbut I think we laid\n\n526\n00:35:41.419 --> 00:35:51.220\nthe
  groundwork for the freedom\nthat players have today.\n\n527\n00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.119\nWe
  laid the groundwork for\n\n528\n00:35:54.119 --> 00:36:00.740\nplayers getting a
  fair\nshare of the revenue.\n\n529\n00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:06.819\nWe laid the groundwork
  that\n\n530\n00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:13.340\nallowed players to be\ntreated like
  human beings.\n\n531\n00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:19.560\nYeah as opposed to\nsome sense
  property.\n\n532\n00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.239\nAnd along the way,\n\n533\n00:36:23.239
  --> 00:36:29.640\nI got to meet and work with\na bunch of great lawyers.\n\n534\n00:36:29.640
  --> 00:36:38.720\nLaris, Gene Keating,\nEd Gen Ed Garvey.\n\n535\n00:36:38.960 -->
  00:36:45.560\nI got to see the inside,\n\n536\n00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.099\nwhat
  the law is all about,\n\n537\n00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:52.639\nand what good\nlawyering
  looks like.\n\n538\n00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:56.600\nSo is it fair to say that\nthat
  was an influence\n\n539\n00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.440\non a decision to\npursue
  a career?\n\n540\n00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.219\nI was that just\n\n541\n00:37:04.219
  --> 00:37:07.019\nconfirmed. That is\nsomething you wanted to do.\n\n542\n00:37:07.019
  --> 00:37:09.659\nThat that was something\nthat I wanted to do.\n\n543\n00:37:11.420
  --> 00:37:19.560\nI enrolled at Wayam Mitchell\nin the fall of 1968,\n\n544\n00:37:19.560
  --> 00:37:22.780\nthe start of my second\nyear in the league.\n\n545\n00:37:26.440
  --> 00:37:29.320\nIt was not pretty.\n\n546\n00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.839\nWhy
  not?\n\n547\n00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:38.140\nWell, you know, you get that\nassignment
  over the summer,\n\n548\n00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.639\nand there are like,\n\n549\n00:37:39.639
  --> 00:37:42.239\n500 pages to read.\n\n550\n00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.000\nYou
  try to read it, and\nnone of it makes sense,\n\n551\n00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.999\nand
  you show up\n\n552\n00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:50.859\nthe first day and I don''t\nremember
  what the class was,\n\n553\n00:37:50.859 --> 00:37:58.719\nbut The professor could
  just\nas well be talking Greek.\n\n554\n00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:01.260\nYeah. As
  English.\n\n555\n00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:08.579\nAnd you think I don''t understand\nwhat''s
  happening here.\n\n556\n00:38:08.579 --> 00:38:12.700\nBecause it''s a it''s\na
  different process.\n\n557\n00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.439\nSure. At least it was
  a\ndifferent process from For sure.\n\n558\n00:38:15.439 --> 00:38:18.759\nWhat
  my undergraduate\ndegree was Yeah, like.\n\n559\n00:38:18.759 --> 00:38:21.779\nAnd
  I was not ready for it.\n\n560\n00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.169\nWas it well, you
  said you\n\n561\n00:38:26.169 --> 00:38:29.770\nsecond year in the\nleague, playing.\n\n562\n00:38:29.770
  --> 00:38:31.549\nAnd so it I mean,\n\n563\n00:38:31.549 --> 00:38:33.449\nI suspect
  that\nobviously that has\n\n564\n00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:36.730\nplaying is a lot
  of a time\ncommitment in of itself.\n\n565\n00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:37.809\nSo it
  was just that you weren''t\n\n566\n00:38:37.809 --> 00:38:39.049\nquite ready, not
  enough time,\n\n567\n00:38:39.049 --> 00:38:45.989\nor did it it wasn''t that\nit
  was being confronted\n\n568\n00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:52.510\nwith being in this class\n\n569\n00:38:52.510
  --> 00:39:01.330\nand listening to these\nlectures that have no context.\n\n570\n00:39:01.330
  --> 00:39:05.830\nRight. And therefore,\nmake no sense.\n\n571\n00:39:05.830 -->
  00:39:09.410\nAnd, you know, it''s\nearly on in the process,\n\n572\n00:39:09.410
  --> 00:39:11.390\nso you don''t know how\nit all fits together.\n\n573\n00:39:11.390
  --> 00:39:15.189\nNew language. New\nlanguage, all of it.\n\n574\n00:39:16.470 -->
  00:39:24.470\nAnd I just It was not pretty.\n\n575\n00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.330\nWell,
  but it bust out.\nSo it didn''t dissuade\n\n576\n00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.910\nyou
  obviously. Well, completely.\n\n577\n00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:39.750\nI I say only
  half in jest.\n\n578\n00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:45.390\nI knew after three days that\nI
  wasn''t going to survive.\n\n579\n00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:50.889\nBut I was in so
  far over\nmy head that it took me\n\n580\n00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.309\nanother
  three and a\nthree weeks to figure\n\n581\n00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:56.189\nout how
  to drop out to get out.\n\n582\n00:39:56.189 --> 00:39:57.589\nAnd\n\n583\n00:40:05.440
  --> 00:40:08.399\nI what I\n\n584\n00:40:08.399 --> 00:40:13.339\ncame to understand
  was first\nof all, that I wasn''t alone.\n\n585\n00:40:13.339 --> 00:40:16.239\nYeah.
  I mean, I''m\nsitting there thinking,\n\n586\n00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:18.259\nI''m
  the only one that\ndoesn''t get this.\n\n587\n00:40:18.259 --> 00:40:22.239\nMm
  hm. I''m the only one that\ndoesn''t understand this.\n\n588\n00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.539\nBut,
  you know,\neverybody in the room\n\n589\n00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:28.339\nwas in the
  same boat that I was.\n\n590\n00:40:28.339 --> 00:40:32.399\nRight. And had I\n\n591\n00:40:33.630
  --> 00:40:35.849\nMaybe had I not been\n\n592\n00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:38.070\nplaying
  football at\nthe time, Mm hmm.\n\n593\n00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.329\nI''d have
  sort of stuck it out.\n\n594\n00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:45.649\nBut I mean, I was so\nfar
  in over my head.\n\n595\n00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:49.329\nI mean, I just I just\ncouldn''t
  see The path.\n\n596\n00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:52.469\nThe path. Yeah.\nYep. Overwhelming.\n\n597\n00:40:52.469
  --> 00:40:55.230\nAnd so I bailed.\n\n598\n00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.069\nYeah.\n\n599\n00:40:56.069
  --> 00:41:04.229\nI bailed. But didn''t\nnecessarily give up right?\n\n600\n00:41:04.229
  --> 00:41:08.049\nThe hope or the idea.\n\n601\n00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:13.110\nOver
  the years, I tried one\nor two other career options.\n\n602\n00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.110\nI
  was a used car salesman,\n\n603\n00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.810\nor actually a new
  c\nnew used car salesman.\n\n604\n00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:26.850\nI sold one car
  during my\nauto sales experience.\n\n605\n00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.089\nI did not
  know that. And\nthat you tried that.\n\n606\n00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:32.330\nAnd
  the one car I\nsold to myself.\n\n607\n00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:35.809\nI figured
  there was\nno career in that.\n\n608\n00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:41.410\nI had a vending
  machine company\n\n609\n00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:44.449\nfor about a year and a half.\n\n610\n00:41:44.449
  --> 00:41:48.489\nIt took me I invested\nabout $40.000 into it,\n\n611\n00:41:48.489
  --> 00:41:50.529\nand it took me about\na year and a half\n\n612\n00:41:50.529 -->
  00:41:52.549\nto go through that.\n\n613\n00:41:52.549 --> 00:41:58.269\nAlthough
  that was one\n\n614\n00:41:58.269 --> 00:42:00.409\nof the actually not one\n\n615\n00:42:00.409
  --> 00:42:03.509\nof the best investment\nI ever made.\n\n616\n00:42:03.509 -->
  00:42:05.149\nAnd we''ll get to that later.\n\n617\n00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:10.629\nSure.
  But, One of\n\n618\n00:42:10.629 --> 00:42:18.490\nthe things I was\nlearning was
  business,\n\n619\n00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:23.549\nbeing in business was not\nsomething
  that fit me.\n\n620\n00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:25.489\nNot something that\ninterested
  me.\n\n621\n00:42:25.489 --> 00:42:30.229\nNo something that\nI wanted to put\n\n622\n00:42:30.229
  --> 00:42:35.589\nthe time and energy and\neffort into becoming good at?\n\n623\n00:42:35.589
  --> 00:42:36.789\nYeah.\n\n624\n00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.159\nWhich was a good\nlesson
  to learn.\n\n625\n00:42:46.159 --> 00:42:55.620\nAnd ultimately, after my\neighth
  year with the Vikings,\n\n626\n00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.120\nI decided to go\nback
  to law school.\n\n627\n00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.139\nThis time, having a\nbetter
  understanding,\n\n628\n00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:06.719\nhaving been involved\nin as
  a players rep,\n\n629\n00:43:06.719 --> 00:43:08.299\nand then ultimately on\n\n630\n00:43:08.299
  --> 00:43:11.679\nthe Executive Committee of\nthe Players Association,\n\n631\n00:43:11.679
  --> 00:43:15.979\nthe involved in a\nnumber of lawsuits\n\n632\n00:43:15.979 -->
  00:43:18.819\ninvolving the\nplayers Association\n\n633\n00:43:18.819 --> 00:43:21.960\nand
  the National Football age.\n\n634\n00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.879\nStill, I mean,
  having\nthe opportunity to see\n\n635\n00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:34.380\neven more
  deeply how lawyers\n\n636\n00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.659\nworked the way they\n\n637\n00:43:36.659
  --> 00:43:40.699\nthought developing a\nsense for that and\n\n638\n00:43:40.699
  --> 00:43:43.359\nhaving the opportunity\nto talk with\n\n639\n00:43:43.359 -->
  00:43:48.039\nthem and sort of learned that,\n\n640\n00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:50.499\nyou
  know, law school\nwas just like that.\n\n641\n00:43:50.499 --> 00:43:56.680\nYeah.
  And that the secret\nto it is to endure.\n\n642\n00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.789\nAnd
  At some point,\n\n643\n00:43:59.789 --> 00:44:01.069\nit starts to make sins.\n\n644\n00:44:01.069
  --> 00:44:05.449\nYeah. So after my eighth year,\n\n645\n00:44:05.449 --> 00:44:07.769\nI
  decided to go back this time,\n\n646\n00:44:07.769 --> 00:44:10.370\nroll at the
  University\nof Minnesota.\n\n647\n00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:17.269\nActually started
  summer of 1975\n\n648\n00:44:17.269 --> 00:44:21.530\nat the University\nof Texas
  at Austin.\n\n649\n00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:27.950\nOh. I took contracts\nand procedure.\n\n650\n00:44:27.950
  --> 00:44:29.930\n13 weeks start to finish.\n\n651\n00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.550\nWow.\n\n652\n00:44:31.550
  --> 00:44:34.369\nAnd survived it. There you go.\n\n653\n00:44:34.369 --> 00:44:36.009\nAnd
  not only survived it,\n\n654\n00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:37.529\nloved every minute
  of it.\n\n655\n00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:38.970\nConfidence booster?\n\n656\n00:44:38.970
  --> 00:44:40.490\nBig confidence booster.\n\n657\n00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:41.249\nAbsolutely.\n\n658\n00:44:41.249
  --> 00:44:46.569\nBig confidence booster.\nLearned, you know,\n\n659\n00:44:46.569
  --> 00:44:49.589\na little bit of\nthe process of you\n\n660\n00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:51.289\nremember
  I talked about having\n\n661\n00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:52.729\nfailed to learn how
  to learn?\n\n662\n00:44:52.729 --> 00:44:55.329\nExactly. Took me to\nlaw school
  to get it.\n\n663\n00:44:55.329 --> 00:44:57.029\nSometimes I wonder if it takes\n\n664\n00:44:57.029
  --> 00:44:58.989\na lot of people up\nuntil that point.\n\n665\n00:44:58.989 -->
  00:45:00.389\nIn some ways, you know,\n\n666\n00:45:00.389 --> 00:45:01.729\nI sort
  of felt the same way.\n\n667\n00:45:01.729 --> 00:45:04.569\nWell, but once I got
  it.\n\n668\n00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:08.419\nYeah. There''s nothing\nelse like it.\n\n669\n00:45:08.419
  --> 00:45:13.939\nRight. And so I I love the\nlaw school experience.\n\n670\n00:45:13.939
  --> 00:45:16.199\nPeople, you know, are\nalways talking about,\n\n671\n00:45:16.199
  --> 00:45:18.600\nyou went to law school and\nplayed professional football.\n\n672\n00:45:18.600
  --> 00:45:20.999\nHow hard that must have been.\n\n673\n00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:22.799\nWell,
  you know, it was yeah,\n\n674\n00:45:22.799 --> 00:45:24.839\nI mean, things are
  hard.\n\n675\n00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:26.999\nBut when you''re having fun,\n\n676\n00:45:26.999
  --> 00:45:33.679\nm there''s there''s\nnothing better. Yeah.\n\n677\n00:45:33.679
  --> 00:45:38.279\nI love my law school\nexperience at the university.\n\n678\n00:45:39.800
  --> 00:45:49.260\nAnd I I had another one of\nthose defining moments.\n\n679\n00:45:49.260
  --> 00:45:58.919\nI think it was the towards\nthe end of my first year.\n\n680\n00:45:59.760
  --> 00:46:03.639\nWe had a paper to write.\n\n681\n00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:09.859\nAnd
  I decided I was going to,\n\n682\n00:46:09.859 --> 00:46:12.659\nyou know, take
  the easy road.\n\n683\n00:46:12.659 --> 00:46:15.960\nSomething you know about labor.\n\n684\n00:46:15.960
  --> 00:46:19.780\nLabor law and actually,\n\n685\n00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.079\nI
  think I wrote\n\n686\n00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:29.179\nsomething on labor\nrelations
  in N in the NFL.\n\n687\n00:46:29.179 --> 00:46:32.559\nYeah. But I, you know,\n\n688\n00:46:33.600
  --> 00:46:38.280\nI spent all this time doing\nthe research and preparing,\n\n689\n00:46:38.280
  --> 00:46:42.080\nand I just nothing happened.\n\n690\n00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.619\nAnd
  I can remember\ngoing in to see one of\n\n691\n00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:48.159\nthe
  associate or assistant\ndeans and saying,\n\n692\n00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:50.819\nyou
  know, I don''t know\nthat I can do this.\n\n693\n00:46:50.819 --> 00:46:53.639\nAnd
  he said, Well,\nyou can do it.\n\n694\n00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:55.840\nAll you have
  to do\nis apply yourself.\n\n695\n00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.399\nWhat have I been
  doing?\n\n696\n00:46:58.399 --> 00:47:00.999\nYou know, All that\nclears it up,
  right.\n\n697\n00:47:00.999 --> 00:47:03.259\nRight. He said, No.\n\n698\n00:47:03.259
  --> 00:47:05.619\nYou apply the seat\nof your pants to\n\n699\n00:47:05.619 -->
  00:47:11.339\nthe chair until you get it\nuntil it starts coming.\n\n700\n00:47:11.339
  --> 00:47:14.769\nYeah. And, you know,\n\n701\n00:47:14.769 --> 00:47:18.369\nit''s
  weird, but, you\nknow, I sat down,\n\n702\n00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:22.749\ngot my
  books and my pins\nin my papers and sat\n\n703\n00:47:22.749 --> 00:47:27.249\nthere
  and eventually started\nwriting and got it done.\n\n704\n00:47:27.249 --> 00:47:28.369\nYeah.\n\n705\n00:47:28.690
  --> 00:47:32.870\nAnd that was an important lesson\n\n706\n00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:41.129\nthat
  sometimes even when you\nknow what you want to do,\n\n707\n00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.910\nBut
  it''s not coming together.\n\n708\n00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:52.890\nYou have to just
  keep working\nat it. Until it happens.\n\n709\n00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.009\nThis
  is jumping a a, so\nwe''ll have to swing back,\n\n710\n00:47:56.009 --> 00:47:57.969\nbut
  that makes me think about\n\n711\n00:47:57.969 --> 00:48:00.169\nthe process of
  sitting down and\n\n712\n00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:03.249\nwriting an opinion\na little
  bit, too.\n\n713\n00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.629\nI there a similarity there too?\n\n714\n00:48:07.629
  --> 00:48:09.229\nThe process of just\nneeding to sit down\n\n715\n00:48:09.229
  --> 00:48:11.109\nand sort of delve in\nto get it started,\n\n716\n00:48:11.109
  --> 00:48:12.910\nand once it started it flows.\n\n717\n00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:16.469\nAbsolutely.
  Absolutely. Yeah.\n\n718\n00:48:16.469 --> 00:48:18.610\nInteresting.\n\n719\n00:48:20.130
  --> 00:48:23.090\nSo law school at UFM.\n\n720\n00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:25.189\nAnd
  I was going to ask you,\n\n721\n00:48:25.189 --> 00:48:28.129\nand I think you really\nanswered
  it was, you know,\n\n722\n00:48:28.129 --> 00:48:30.710\nby the time you\ndo go
  to the UFM,\n\n723\n00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:34.550\nyou''re still playing\nraising
  a family.\n\n724\n00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.329\nNot like there aren''t any\nother
  things going on.\n\n725\n00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:39.529\nYou''re busy, but\nyou can
  manage it\n\n726\n00:48:39.529 --> 00:48:42.270\nby then it''s just a matter\nof
  time management.\n\n727\n00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:45.109\nSure. And figuring out how
  to,\n\n728\n00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:47.049\nyou know, make it all work.\n\n729\n00:48:47.049
  --> 00:48:49.610\nPutting all the pieces together.\n\n730\n00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.190\nAnd
  I mean, I did\nhave some incentive.\n\n731\n00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.289\nI mean,
  by then, I was\n\n732\n00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:00.670\n12 years into my\nprofessional
  career.\n\n733\n00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.270\nYou don''t play forever.\n\n734\n00:49:03.270
  --> 00:49:05.369\nAnd quite frankly, I didn''t\n\n735\n00:49:05.369 --> 00:49:08.850\nwant
  to necessarily\nplay forever.\n\n736\n00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:15.209\nU As I said,\n\n737\n00:49:15.209
  --> 00:49:19.310\noften, by the time I\nstarted law school,\n\n738\n00:49:19.310
  --> 00:49:22.809\nI''d been playing for I\nwas into my ninth year.\n\n739\n00:49:22.809
  --> 00:49:24.730\nAnd I hadn''t done everything\n\n740\n00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.390\nyou
  could do on a\nfootball field,\n\n741\n00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.769\nbut I''d done
  most of them.\n\n742\n00:49:27.769 --> 00:49:31.310\nRight. And I noted earlier,\n\n743\n00:49:31.310
  --> 00:49:35.570\nrepetition wasn''t one\nof my st strong suits.\n\n744\n00:49:35.570
  --> 00:49:38.530\nIt was time to prepare\nto do something\n\n745\n00:49:38.530 -->
  00:49:42.469\ndifferent and so that\nI could move on.\n\n746\n00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:45.049\nAs
  I''ve often said, you know,\n\n747\n00:49:45.049 --> 00:49:48.850\nthe skills of
  a defensive tackle\n\n748\n00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.669\ndon''t transfer to much\n\n749\n00:49:50.669
  --> 00:49:53.450\nof anything else out\nin the real world.\n\n750\n00:49:53.450
  --> 00:50:01.479\nAnd so preparing to\n\n751\n00:50:01.479 --> 00:50:05.640\ndo
  something beyond football\nwas really important.\n\n752\n00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.579\nAnd
  law school was that\npreparation. Right?\n\n753\n00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:16.660\nRight?
  So you graduate\nfrom law school.\n\n754\n00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.959\nAnd you
  graduate and\nwhat''s the timing there?\n\n755\n00:50:20.959 --> 00:50:23.100\nYou
  still play for a little\nbit after you graduate?\n\n756\n00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.279\n3.5
  more years. 3.5 more years.\n\n757\n00:50:25.279 --> 00:50:28.419\nAnd year 378,
  79,\nfour more years.\n\n758\n00:50:28.419 --> 00:50:31.919\nOkay. And during that
  time then,\n\n759\n00:50:31.919 --> 00:50:33.539\nyou''ve graduated,\nyou''re playing,\n\n760\n00:50:33.539
  --> 00:50:36.820\nbut then you start\nat Linus in Benham.\n\n761\n00:50:36.820 -->
  00:50:39.320\nSo what''s the practice\n\n762\n00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.739\nthere
  like? Tell me\nabout that a little bit.\n\n763\n00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.499\nIt''s
  trying to figure out\nwho you are as a lawyer.\n\n764\n00:50:45.499 --> 00:50:52.729\nYeah.
  And it''s, you know,\ngetting assignments.\n\n765\n00:50:52.729 --> 00:50:56.879\nAnd,
  you know, here''s the file.\n\n766\n00:50:56.879 --> 00:51:04.399\nGo do this. And
  it''s like,\nhow do you go do this?\n\n767\n00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.620\nLittle
  more explanation.\n\n768\n00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.339\nWould be helpful?\nRight.
  It wasn''t\n\n769\n00:51:10.339 --> 00:51:12.920\nalways forthcoming. Mm hm.\n\n770\n00:51:12.920
  --> 00:51:18.919\nYou sort of get thrown\ninto the thick of things,\n\n771\n00:51:18.919
  --> 00:51:20.820\nand there were some horrible,\n\n772\n00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.520\nawful,
  very bad moments.\n\n773\n00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.219\nWhere I had no idea\nwhat
  I was doing,\n\n774\n00:51:30.219 --> 00:51:34.979\nbut had to try to figure it\nout
  while I was doing it.\n\n775\n00:51:34.979 --> 00:51:39.719\nYeah. Enjoyable, though?\n\n776\n00:51:41.400
  --> 00:51:49.049\nNot especially. No.\nOne of the things I\n\n777\n00:51:49.049
  --> 00:51:51.329\nfigured out early on about\n\n778\n00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:56.170\nthe
  private practice of\nlaw, it''s about business.\n\n779\n00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.050\nIt''s
  about billing hours.\n\n780\n00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:04.809\nAnd that just is\nnever
  that is not me.\n\n781\n00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:12.170\nM interest in the law\nwas
  the law and trying\n\n782\n00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:17.149\nto work through it and\nsort
  it out and figure it\n\n783\n00:52:17.149 --> 00:52:23.489\nout and come to the
  best\nconclusions that you can.\n\n784\n00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:30.349\nAnd when
  You''ve got\n\n785\n00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:32.369\nthis little thing sitting on\n\n786\n00:52:32.369
  --> 00:52:36.590\nyour shoulder talking\nabout billable hours.\n\n787\n00:52:36.590
  --> 00:52:39.669\nFirst of all, you''re distracted\nby that because you''re\n\n788\n00:52:39.669
  --> 00:52:42.669\nthinking that my Hey,\n\n789\n00:52:42.669 --> 00:52:43.989\nam
  I billing enough hours?\n\n790\n00:52:43.989 --> 00:52:49.550\nAnd how do I justify\nthese
  hours? Right.\n\n791\n00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.010\nSo from that standpoint,\n\n792\n00:52:52.010
  --> 00:52:55.630\nit was not necessarily pleasant.\n\n793\n00:52:55.630 --> 00:53:01.030\nThat
  said, I got to work with\nsome really good lawyers.\n\n794\n00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.589\nYeah.
  And like every\nother, you know,\n\n795\n00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:09.909\nnew lawyer,
  can you do a\nmemo on me for me on this?\n\n796\n00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:12.549\nAnd
  you give them\n\n797\n00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:15.869\nthe memo and it comes\nback
  and it''s like,\n\n798\n00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:20.079\nI didn''t know there was
  that\nmuch red ink in the world.\n\n799\n00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:21.359\nYeah.\n\n800\n00:53:22.440
  --> 00:53:25.659\nBut lessons then, as well,\nI suppose, too, right?\n\n801\n00:53:25.659
  --> 00:53:27.919\nSo you''re Absolutely. It''s\na big learning curve,\n\n802\n00:53:27.919
  --> 00:53:29.999\nbut you''re learning a lot.\nBut you''re learning a lot.\n\n803\n00:53:29.999
  --> 00:53:33.120\nYeah. That''s where\nI got grounded.\n\n804\n00:53:33.120 -->
  00:53:35.100\nYeah. And so from\nthat standpoint,\n\n805\n00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:39.539\nit
  was a very\nvaluable experience,\n\n806\n00:53:39.539 --> 00:53:44.779\nbut just
  not my idea\nof a good time.\n\n807\n00:53:44.779 --> 00:53:49.359\nYeah. And I
  was\nfortunate enough to\n\n808\n00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:57.090\nMake my way to the\nattorney
  general''s office.\n\n809\n00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:01.069\nRight. And I loved it
  there\n\n810\n00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:06.849\nbecause Skip Humphrey was\nthe attorney
  general. Mm hm.\n\n811\n00:54:06.849 --> 00:54:13.860\nAnd He let the lawyers\n\n812\n00:54:13.860
  --> 00:54:17.599\nwho were there to do\nthe work do the work.\n\n813\n00:54:17.720
  --> 00:54:21.799\nAnd let me learn to\n\n814\n00:54:21.799 --> 00:54:26.420\ngive
  my best legal\nadvice to my clients.\n\n815\n00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.720\nI didn''t
  have to worry\nabout billing hours.\n\n816\n00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.159\nDidn''t
  have to worry about\nclients walking away.\n\n817\n00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:39.679\nTrue.
  I could do the best\nthat I could to figure out\n\n818\n00:54:39.679 --> 00:54:47.509\nwhat
  is the best\nWhat is the law?\n\n819\n00:54:47.509 --> 00:54:50.069\nAnd what is
  the best\nadvice I can give\n\n820\n00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:53.329\nthis client?
  And\nI could do that.\n\n821\n00:54:53.329 --> 00:54:56.749\nAnd there''s a lot\nof
  freedom in that.\n\n822\n00:54:56.749 --> 00:55:01.909\nAnd I absolutely loved it.\n\n823\n00:55:01.990
  --> 00:55:04.690\nDid you have a particular focus\n\n824\n00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:06.069\nin
  the Attorney General''s side?\n\n825\n00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.269\nLabor and employment?
  You were.\n\n826\n00:55:07.269 --> 00:55:09.550\nOkay. Labor and employment.\n\n827\n00:55:09.550
  --> 00:55:12.649\nAnd you enjoyed it that''s\nwhat I did at List also.\n\n828\n00:55:12.649
  --> 00:55:15.289\nSure. On the employee side,\n\n829\n00:55:15.289 --> 00:55:18.829\nthen
  just flip to\nthe employer side.\n\n830\n00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.429\nA you''re
  working at\n\n831\n00:55:22.429 --> 00:55:26.070\nthe Minnesota Attorney\nGeneral''s
  office.\n\n832\n00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.289\nFour years, five years,\nsomething
  like that?\n\n833\n00:55:30.289 --> 00:55:32.329\nStarted in 985.\n\n834\n00:55:32.329
  --> 00:55:33.469\nOkay.\n\n835\n00:55:33.469 --> 00:55:37.470\nThe first week of
  January 1985\n\n836\n00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:43.430\nand left the last week\nof December
  in 1992.\n\n837\n00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:53.229\nOkay. So yeah. So when do\nyou start
  thinking about?\n\n838\n00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.909\nMaybe not even necessarily\nthe
  Minnesota Supreme Court,\n\n839\n00:55:56.909 --> 00:55:58.069\nbut the idea of
  doing something\n\n840\n00:55:58.069 --> 00:56:00.250\ndifferent and maybe\nthat
  being judging.\n\n841\n00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:07.959\nYou know, the I had\nthis
  weird experience.\n\n842\n00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.120\n1982, I''m at Lyncest and
  Venom.\n\n843\n00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:17.100\nMm hmm. And 82 or 83.\n\n844\n00:56:17.100
  --> 00:56:19.619\nAnd I wake up one morning,\n\n845\n00:56:19.619 --> 00:56:22.040\nand
  the newspaper has an article\n\n846\n00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:27.520\nabout Governor
  Perfi is going\nto appoint some new judges.\n\n847\n00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.459\nAnd
  he''s got my\nname in the list.\n\n848\n00:56:29.459 --> 00:56:30.839\nOh.\n\n849\n00:56:31.930
  --> 00:56:37.189\nNobody had asked.\nInteresting. Nobody. It was\n\n850\n00:56:37.189
  --> 00:56:38.930\nit was very strange.\n\n851\n00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:40.489\nBut
  up until that point,\n\n852\n00:56:40.489 --> 00:56:44.109\nit hadn''t really\noccurred
  to me A,\n\n853\n00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:46.389\nthat I would have\n\n854\n00:56:46.389
  --> 00:56:49.669\nany interest in being a\njudge or that I could be.\n\n855\n00:56:49.669
  --> 00:56:53.129\nYeah. Or that, you know,\n\n856\n00:56:53.129 --> 00:56:54.770\nI
  had the skills or temperament.\n\n857\n00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:59.109\nSure. Long
  story short made\nme think about it. Mm hm.\n\n858\n00:56:59.109 --> 00:57:02.769\nAnd
  you know, through that time,\n\n859\n00:57:02.769 --> 00:57:07.469\nI''m learning
  who\nI am as a lawyer,\n\n860\n00:57:07.469 --> 00:57:11.529\nwhat my skills are,\nwhat
  my interests are,\n\n861\n00:57:11.529 --> 00:57:18.949\nand what my strengths\nand
  weaknesses are.\n\n862\n00:57:18.949 --> 00:57:26.429\nYeah. And over time,\n\n863\n00:57:26.429
  --> 00:57:30.009\nI I sort of start\n\n864\n00:57:30.009 --> 00:57:37.969\nthinking
  maybe there is\n\n865\n00:57:37.969 --> 00:57:40.309\nsomething in the judiciary\nthat
  would fit me.\n\n866\n00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:42.729\nBut I can''t see\n\n867\n00:57:42.729
  --> 00:57:47.149\nmyself a necessarily as\na trial court judge.\n\n868\n00:57:51.110
  --> 00:57:55.110\nAnd, you know, as lawyers,\n\n869\n00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:57.530\nwe
  spend a lot of\ntime reading opinions\n\n870\n00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:02.069\nand
  struggling to figure\nout what they mean.\n\n871\n00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:10.009\nAnd
  thinking, well,\nif they meant this,\n\n872\n00:58:10.009 --> 00:58:12.489\nwhy
  didn''t they just say it?\n\n873\n00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:16.449\nWhy did they why\nis
  it so hard to\n\n874\n00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:22.229\nsay in plain clear\nlanguage,
  what you mean?\n\n875\n00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:27.169\nAnd of course, my ego\nsays
  to myself self,\n\n876\n00:58:27.169 --> 00:58:29.449\nyou could do that.\n\n877\n00:58:29.449
  --> 00:58:31.950\nYou could write clearly.\n\n878\n00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:35.289\nYou
  could write concisely.\n\n879\n00:58:35.289 --> 00:58:41.209\nMm hm. And so over
  time,\n\n880\n00:58:41.209 --> 00:58:45.150\nI start to think my skills,\n\n881\n00:58:45.150
  --> 00:58:46.409\nmy interests, abilities,\n\n882\n00:58:46.409 --> 00:58:48.490\nmy
  strengths lend themselves\n\n883\n00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.929\nto what appellate\ncourt
  judges do.\n\n884\n00:58:50.929 --> 00:58:58.429\nAnd from there.\n\n885\n00:59:01.890
  --> 00:59:06.350\nWell, how does one become\nan appellate court judge?\n\n886\n00:59:06.350
  --> 00:59:08.249\nWell, as you know, in Minnesota,\n\n887\n00:59:08.249 --> 00:59:12.490\nit''s
  either by appointment\nor by election.\n\n888\n00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:23.089\nAnd
  the Minnesota Court of\nAppeals is new relatively new.\n\n889\n00:59:23.089 -->
  00:59:24.409\nRight.\n\n890\n00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:28.149\nAnd most of the judges\nthere
  or many of\n\n891\n00:59:28.149 --> 00:59:31.250\nthe judges there have\nbeen trial
  court judges.\n\n892\n00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.569\nSo that seems like\na natural
  step,\n\n893\n00:59:34.569 --> 00:59:37.289\neven though the\ntrial court isn''t\n\n894\n00:59:37.289
  --> 00:59:41.819\nnecessarily what fits me.\n\n895\n00:59:41.819 --> 00:59:48.580\nSure.
  And so I started applying\n\n896\n00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.600\nfor trial court
  judge petitions\n\n897\n00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.640\nand had absolutely no success.\n\n898\n00:59:57.640
  --> 01:00:00.500\nEventually, I came\nto the conclusion\n\n899\n01:00:00.500 -->
  01:00:02.799\nthat I wasn''t going to have\n\n900\n01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:07.179\nany
  success and that\n\n901\n01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:10.019\nif I wanted the\nopportunity
  to serve,\n\n902\n01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:15.440\nit was probably going\nto be through
  election.\n\n903\n01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:19.269\nWhich narrows things down to\n\n904\n01:00:19.269
  --> 01:00:21.349\nthe Court of Appeals\nor the Supreme Court.\n\n905\n01:00:21.349
  --> 01:00:22.649\nRight.\n\n906\n01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:32.229\nAnd My thought process
  was,\n\n907\n01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:37.730\nwell, if you''re going\nto seek collection,\n\n908\n01:00:39.250
  --> 01:00:43.729\nyou might as well seek\n\n909\n01:00:43.729 --> 01:00:45.849\ncollection
  to the\nMinnesota Supreme Court.\n\n910\n01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:48.730\nI think
  I have something\nto contribute.\n\n911\n01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:54.990\nI think
  both from a\nlegal background,\n\n912\n01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.770\nbut also from
  just a\ndifferent perspective.\n\n913\n01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:03.650\nSure. And
  so 1990,\n\n914\n01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:07.390\nI decided to seek collection.\n\n915\n01:01:07.390
  --> 01:01:15.550\nAnd When the filing\nperiod opened,\n\n916\n01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:20.829\nI
  was down there first\nmorning first hour,\n\n917\n01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:23.609\nfiled
  for election and\n\n918\n01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:29.030\nthe justice who I was\ngoing
  to challenge.\n\n919\n01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.530\nI thought I was going\nto challenge,
  resigned.\n\n920\n01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.710\nBefore I got out of the\nSecretary
  of State''s office.\n\n921\n01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:39.290\nOh, wow. Which\ncreated
  a vacancy.\n\n922\n01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.699\nVacancies are filled\nby appointment.\n\n923\n01:01:44.699
  --> 01:01:47.520\nThe governor\nimmediately appointed\n\n924\n01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.320\nsomeone
  to fill the vacancy,\n\n925\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:58.480\nand the election for
  that\nseat no longer existed.\n\n926\n01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:07.030\nAnd I in seeking
  election.\n\n927\n01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:12.390\nIt wasn''t about the\nindividual
  justice?\n\n928\n01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:16.610\nRight, who I was\ngoing to challenge.\n\n929\n01:02:16.610
  --> 01:02:21.789\nIt wasn''t about their opinions\n\n930\n01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:26.870\nor
  their philosophy\nor anything else.\n\n931\n01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:29.649\nIt was
  simply I mean,\n\n932\n01:02:29.649 --> 01:02:31.990\nit seemed to me to\nbe a fair
  question\n\n933\n01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:35.949\ngiven that the justice\nwas going
  to reach\n\n934\n01:02:35.949 --> 01:02:40.690\nmandatory retirement\nwithin something\n\n935\n01:02:40.690
  --> 01:02:44.410\nless than six months\nof re election.\n\n936\n01:02:44.410 -->
  01:02:46.550\nAnd it was a fair question,\n\n937\n01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:50.029\nat
  least I thought\nto have the people\n\n938\n01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:55.589\nMinnesota
  decide who they\nwould want to serve the term.\n\n939\n01:02:55.589 --> 01:03:04.630\nMm
  hm me a known quantity\nor a known person,\n\n940\n01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.589\nor
  ultimately some\nunknown person.\n\n941\n01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:15.510\nUm the election
  was\ntaken off the ballot,\n\n942\n01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:21.669\nand, you know,
  it\nwasn''t clear to me.\n\n943\n01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:30.769\nWhy? You know, being\na
  person of color.\n\n944\n01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:32.569\nOne of the things\nthat
  comes to mind\n\n945\n01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:34.749\nis because I''m a\nperson of
  color.\n\n946\n01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:39.609\nIs it politics? Is\nit I don''t know.\n\n947\n01:03:39.609
  --> 01:03:43.669\nYeah. Let that go.\n\n948\n01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:49.170\nContinued
  working at the\nAttorney General''s office\n\n949\n01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:53.629\nand
  decided to try\nagain in 19 e two.\n\n950\n01:03:53.629 --> 01:04:03.550\nThis time.
  The justice\nI sought to challenge.\n\n951\n01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:07.070\nWas going
  to reach\nmandatory retirement\n\n952\n01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:08.369\nwithin about
  18 months.\n\n953\n01:04:08.369 --> 01:04:13.369\nMm hm of the full six year term.\n\n954\n01:04:13.369
  --> 01:04:14.869\nAnd I thought, again,\n\n955\n01:04:14.869 --> 01:04:17.469\nit
  was a fair question to\nhave the people of Minnesota\n\n956\n01:04:17.469 --> 01:04:27.989\ndecide
  who the justice should\nbe who serves in the see.\n\n957\n01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:32.949\nBefore
  I could get to\nbefore the filings open,\n\n958\n01:04:32.949 --> 01:04:35.649\nwe
  have this provision\nin our Constitution,\n\n959\n01:04:35.649 --> 01:04:39.030\nwhich
  provides for the\nretirement of judges.\n\n960\n01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:45.930\nAnd
  there is There is a statute\n\n961\n01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:50.009\nwhich also provides
  for\n\n962\n01:04:50.009 --> 01:04:53.770\nto carry out that\nconstitutional provision,\n\n963\n01:04:53.770
  --> 01:05:03.190\nwhich provided that the\ngovernor could extend\n\n964\n01:05:03.190
  --> 01:05:09.229\nthe term of a justice who\nhadn''t reached who hadn''t\n\n965\n01:05:09.229
  --> 01:05:13.769\nreached full retirement at\n\n966\n01:05:13.769 --> 01:05:16.370\nthe
  time they were\nup for re election.\n\n967\n01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:19.990\nAnd with
  mandatory\nretirement approaching?\n\n968\n01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:21.329\nSure.\n\n969\n01:05:23.700
  --> 01:05:30.980\nAnd so Justice Yeka,\n\n970\n01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:34.760\nwho
  was the justice I\nwas going to challenge,\n\n971\n01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.800\nsought
  a term extension.\n\n972\n01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.099\nThe governor granted it.\n\n973\n01:05:42.300
  --> 01:05:51.889\nAnd I was to\n\n974\n01:05:51.889 --> 01:05:54.770\nsay the least
  more than\na little frustrated.\n\n975\n01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:59.990\nAnd so long
  story short\n\n976\n01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:04.890\ncommenced a lawsuit against\n\n977\n01:06:04.890
  --> 01:06:08.989\nthe governor and the\nSecretary of State,\n\n978\n01:06:09.270
  --> 01:06:16.289\na lawsuit that had\n\n979\n01:06:16.289 --> 01:06:19.669\nits
  original jurisdiction\nin the Supreme Court.\n\n980\n01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.939\nAnd
  a number of\npeople told me I was\n\n981\n01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:29.879\ncrazy that
  you''re\nwrong on the law.\n\n982\n01:06:29.879 --> 01:06:32.039\nYou''re wrong
  on the politics,\n\n983\n01:06:32.039 --> 01:06:34.759\nand you''re never, you know,\n\n984\n01:06:34.759
  --> 01:06:37.639\nwhen you lose this\nlawsuit, you''re never,\n\n985\n01:06:37.639
  --> 01:06:41.639\never going to have the\nopportunity to serve.\n\n986\n01:06:44.720
  --> 01:06:52.419\nI felt strongly about one\n\n987\n01:06:52.419 --> 01:06:58.280\nthat
  the as applied\n\n988\n01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.279\nthe term extension\nviolated
  the Constitution.\n\n989\n01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.139\nI wasn''t much concerned
  about\n\n990\n01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:09.899\nthe politics because I mean,\n\n991\n01:07:09.899
  --> 01:07:12.559\nI''ve been sort of along the way.\n\n992\n01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.959\nI
  figured out you have to\ndo what you think is right,\n\n993\n01:07:14.959 --> 01:07:17.880\nnot
  what is expedient.\n\n994\n01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:27.679\nAnd turns out I was\nright
  on the law.\n\n995\n01:07:27.679 --> 01:07:30.159\nWe were right on the law.\n\n996\n01:07:30.159
  --> 01:07:35.380\nAnd I was given\n\n997\n01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.399\nthe opportunity
  along with\nanybody else who wanted\n\n998\n01:07:38.399 --> 01:07:42.519\nto file
  for election\nfor the seat,\n\n999\n01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:46.899\nI filed Justice
  Yeka did not.\n\n1000\n01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.539\nAnd two other people did,\n\n1001\n01:07:53.860
  --> 01:07:59.879\nand almost immediately\nnot almost immediately,\n\n1002\n01:07:59.879
  --> 01:08:07.439\nimmediately, my opponents\nstarted down the road of,\n\n1003\n01:08:07.439
  --> 01:08:10.299\nhe''s just a football player.\n\n1004\n01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.179\nAnd
  initially implicit\nbut unstated.\n\n1005\n01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:19.079\nYeah.
  He''s just a\ndumb football player.\n\n1006\n01:08:19.079 --> 01:08:23.999\nAlso
  initially, but not\n\n1007\n01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:29.499\nnecessarily subsequently,\nbut
  initially.\n\n1008\n01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:33.599\nHe''s just a dumb Black\nfootball
  player.\n\n1009\n01:08:33.599 --> 01:08:39.799\nI mean, that was the tenor\nof what
  was being said.\n\n1010\n01:08:39.799 --> 01:08:42.100\nHe''s not qualified.\n\n1011\n01:08:45.020
  --> 01:08:49.359\nI spent the next three months,\n\n1012\n01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.859\n3.5
  months, whatever it is,\n\n1013\n01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:56.799\ncampaigning around\nthe
  state to talk\n\n1014\n01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:01.659\nabout why I wanted to be a\nSupreme
  Court of justice,\n\n1015\n01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:05.019\nwhat I could bring\nwhat
  I had to offer.\n\n1016\n01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.029\nAbout my experience\nand
  my background\n\n1017\n01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:09.270\nand my qualifications.\n\n1018\n01:09:09.270
  --> 01:09:13.169\nMm hm. And at every turn,\n\n1019\n01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:16.609\nI
  got the accusatory question.\n\n1020\n01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:19.150\nWhat are your
  qualifications?\n\n1021\n01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:22.329\nAnd nobody else was\nbeing
  asked that.\n\n1022\n01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:28.249\nAnd so that that was difficult.\n\n1023\n01:09:28.930
  --> 01:09:33.649\nThat said it was\n\n1024\n01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:36.049\nalso
  satisfying to be\nable to talk to people.\n\n1025\n01:09:36.049 --> 01:09:38.209\nYeah.
  About who I am,\n\n1026\n01:09:38.209 --> 01:09:43.449\nand what I thought\nI had
  to offer.\n\n1027\n01:09:43.449 --> 01:09:48.949\nAnd in the end,\n\n1028\n01:09:48.949
  --> 01:09:56.849\nthe people of the state gave\nme the opportunity to serve.\n\n1029\n01:09:59.130
  --> 01:10:02.229\nThey elected me.\n\n1030\n01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:10.199\nI am
  humble, honored.\n\n1031\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.359\nI mean, I have a hard time\n\n1032\n01:10:16.359
  --> 01:10:21.879\narticulating how meaningful\nit is to me that\n\n1033\n01:10:21.879
  --> 01:10:30.429\nthey saw through the\neffort to stereotype me?\n\n1034\n01:10:30.429
  --> 01:10:31.649\nYeah.\n\n1035\n01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:37.189\nThat they saw in\n\n1036\n01:10:37.189
  --> 01:10:45.630\nme somebody who hopefully\nhad something to contribute,\n\n1037\n01:10:45.630
  --> 01:10:49.009\nand they gave me the\nopportunity to do it. Mm hmm.\n\n1038\n01:10:52.790
  --> 01:10:55.709\nWas so, you know,\n\n1039\n01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:58.229\nyou
  mentioned in terms of\n\n1040\n01:10:58.229 --> 01:11:01.910\nthe campaign Questions\nabout
  qualification,\n\n1041\n01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:04.229\nbut implicit\nquestions about
  race.\n\n1042\n01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:06.609\nWhat it means to be\nan athlete race.\n\n1043\n01:11:06.609
  --> 01:11:10.989\nWas was diversity and the\nfact that if elected,\n\n1044\n01:11:10.989
  --> 01:11:12.149\nyou''d be the first African\n\n1045\n01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:14.289\nAmerican
  Minnesota\nSupreme Court Justice,\n\n1046\n01:11:14.289 --> 01:11:16.009\nwas that
  a part of\nthat conversation\n\n1047\n01:11:16.009 --> 01:11:17.909\nexplicitly
  or was that not\nreally a part of that?\n\n1048\n01:11:17.909 --> 01:11:19.009\nThat
  wasn''t a part of.\n\n1049\n01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.709\nThat wasn''t a part\nof
  the discussion.\n\n1050\n01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:27.369\nSo you''re elected.\n\n1051\n01:11:27.369
  --> 01:11:31.229\nAnd I show up the first day.\n\n1052\n01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:33.569\nWhat''s
  the first day like?\n\n1053\n01:11:33.569 --> 01:11:37.849\nWell, I had a month
  before.\n\n1054\n01:11:37.849 --> 01:11:43.709\nI''d been given briefs\nfor for
  the Get to work.\n\n1055\n01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:53.309\nYes. For the argument calendar\nin
  January of e three.\n\n1056\n01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:57.509\nAnd initially, I\nhad
  been assigned\n\n1057\n01:11:57.509 --> 01:12:03.469\na case that was being\nheard
  that first day.\n\n1058\n01:12:03.469 --> 01:12:04.829\nOkay.\n\n1059\n01:12:09.350
  --> 01:12:13.209\nMind you. I hadn''t\n\n1060\n01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:17.269\nI
  I didn''t know how the\nsystem worked, right?\n\n1061\n01:12:17.269 --> 01:12:20.469\nRight.
  The norms, the\nprocesses the norms,\n\n1062\n01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.749\nthe
  process any of it.\n\n1063\n01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:27.889\nAnd so I''m fast tracking,\n\n1064\n01:12:27.889
  --> 01:12:30.129\ntrying to figure all this out.\n\n1065\n01:12:30.129 --> 01:12:34.909\nAnd
  it turns out the\ncase that they gave me.\n\n1066\n01:12:34.909 --> 01:12:43.649\nI
  had a conflict. So they\n\n1067\n01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:48.909\nswitched cases and
  gave me\none for the second day.\n\n1068\n01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:52.969\nI was getting
  my\nbaptism by fire.\n\n1069\n01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:54.189\nYeah.\n\n1070\n01:12:56.590

  01:13:20.349\nBecause I hadn''t been\non the court, right?\n\n1075\n01:13:22.270
  --> 01:13:24.969\nBut I had to sort\nof figure that out,\n\n1076\n01:13:24.969 -->
  01:13:31.969\nbut I had no sort of\ncontext for doing that.\n\n1077\n01:13:31.969
  --> 01:13:33.189\nYeah.\n\n1078\n01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:39.629\nAnd I was sworn\n\n1079\n01:13:39.629

  That''s the way it began.\n\n1102\n01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:05.159\nWe don''t do that
  anymore.\n\n1103\n01:15:05.159 --> 01:15:08.439\nAt least when I left the court,\n\n1104\n01:15:08.760
  --> 01:15:14.319\nnew justices had some\ntime to learn the system.\n\n1105\n01:15:17.080
  --> 01:15:19.279\nSo was that I mean,\n\n1106\n01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:21.719\ndo
  you do you think\nback on the beyond\n\n1107\n01:15:21.719 --> 01:15:24.599\nthe
  first day or to the first\nweek, the first month is?\n\n1108\n01:15:24.599 --> 01:15:26.739\nWas
  it sort of because\n\n1109\n01:15:26.739 --> 01:15:29.339\nit was trial by fire
  a\nlittle bit right away,\n\n1110\n01:15:29.339 --> 01:15:31.199\nthat it was a
  easy transition.\n\n1111\n01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:35.060\nI mean, hard right away,
  but\na quick one or Invigorating.\n\n1112\n01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:40.200\nYeah.
  And a very\nquick transition.\n\n1113\n01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.679\nYou know,
  as with anything new,\n\n1114\n01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:47.959\nparticularly in\nthe
  world of work.\n\n1115\n01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.799\nYou don''t know the rules
  and\n\n1116\n01:15:52.799 --> 01:15:55.879\nthe norms until\nyou violate them.\n\n1117\n01:15:55.879
  --> 01:16:01.819\nAnd so you''re trying to figure\nit all out and you know,\n\n1118\n01:16:01.819
  --> 01:16:03.399\nyou have your missteps\nalong the way,\n\n1119\n01:16:03.399 -->
  01:16:04.319\nbut you figured it out.\n\n1120\n01:16:04.319 --> 01:16:08.479\nSure.
  And as with many things,\n\n1121\n01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:11.619\nthe question isn''t
  whether\nyou made the mistake.\n\n1122\n01:16:11.619 --> 01:16:19.519\nWhat did
  you learn from it?\nIn this particular instance,\n\n1123\n01:16:19.519 --> 01:16:23.120\nI
  had to be a quick learner\nand I was. Absolutely.\n\n1124\n01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:32.719\nAnd
  then, you know, you get\nthat first case behind you,\n\n1125\n01:16:32.719 --> 01:16:36.019\nthe
  argument and the report.\n\n1126\n01:16:36.019 --> 01:16:39.539\nAnd then you got
  to\nwrite an opinion.\n\n1127\n01:16:39.539 --> 01:16:41.839\nYou got more work
  to\ndo. It''s not over.\n\n1128\n01:16:41.839 --> 01:16:45.019\nAnd having never
  written\nan opinion before,\n\n1129\n01:16:45.019 --> 01:16:47.319\nyou have to
  learn\nhow to do that.\n\n1130\n01:16:47.319 --> 01:16:50.199\nWhich is a whole
  other\nbeast in and of itself.\n\n1131\n01:16:50.199 --> 01:16:52.739\nAbsolutely,
  but I had\n\n1132\n01:16:52.739 --> 01:17:02.839\na good law cl I who\nhelped me
  a lot.\n\n1133\n01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:10.919\nHe helped me a lot.\nAnd as over
  the years,\n\n1134\n01:17:10.919 --> 01:17:13.739\nI had a bunch of great clerks\n\n1135\n01:17:13.739
  --> 01:17:17.519\nwho made me look good\ntime and time again.\n\n1136\n01:17:20.120
  --> 01:17:22.539\nI wanted to ask about clerks,\n\n1137\n01:17:22.539 --> 01:17:24.479\nnot
  in a selfish\nway, but, you know,\n\n1138\n01:17:24.479 --> 01:17:25.779\nit''s
  a part of it''s definitely\n\n1139\n01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:26.919\na part of your\nwork
  on the court,\n\n1140\n01:17:26.919 --> 01:17:29.119\na daily work on the court.\n\n1141\n01:17:30.240
  --> 01:17:36.019\nWhat did you look for in\na clerk and kind of I I\n\n1142\n01:17:36.019
  --> 01:17:42.319\nlooked for people\nwho were curious.\n\n1143\n01:17:45.440 -->
  01:17:48.799\nPeople who had something in\n\n1144\n01:17:48.799 --> 01:17:53.399\ntheir
  background that\nwas out of the norm.\n\n1145\n01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.619\nJustice
  Garter ring\nused to refer to\n\n1146\n01:18:00.619 --> 01:18:03.659\nwhat she called
  standard\nissue law students.\n\n1147\n01:18:03.659 --> 01:18:12.939\nSills. I didn''t
  want\nstandard issue law clerks.\n\n1148\n01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:15.439\nI wanted
  people\n\n1149\n01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.679\nObviously,\n\n1150\n01:18:25.679
  --> 01:18:27.399\nyou want somebody\nthat can write.\n\n1151\n01:18:27.399 --> 01:18:29.979\nYou
  want somebody that''s\ngoing to work hard.\n\n1152\n01:18:29.979 --> 01:18:32.359\nBut
  you want\nsomebody who''s going\n\n1153\n01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:36.499\nto have
  good judgment\nand a sense of\n\n1154\n01:18:36.499 --> 01:18:39.819\ncuriosity
  to sort of look\nunder the rocks that\n\n1155\n01:18:39.819 --> 01:18:41.419\nneed
  to be looked under\n\n1156\n01:18:41.419 --> 01:18:43.959\nand not under the\nones
  that don''t,\n\n1157\n01:18:43.959 --> 01:18:46.539\nand who can figure\nthat out
  quickly?\n\n1158\n01:18:46.539 --> 01:18:47.679\nYeah.\n\n1159\n01:18:51.040 -->
  01:18:57.929\nAnd who are\n\n1160\n01:18:57.929 --> 01:19:01.249\nwilling to or
  who\n\n1161\n01:19:01.249 --> 01:19:04.309\nare willing to tell\nme when I was wrong.\n\n1162\n01:19:04.309
  --> 01:19:07.309\nI didn''t I didn''t\nneed a law clerk or\n\n1163\n01:19:07.309
  --> 01:19:12.489\na law clerks who would tell\nme what I want to hear.\n\n1164\n01:19:14.490
  --> 01:19:20.830\nI''m I''m I don''t like surprises.\n\n1165\n01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:25.429\nAnd
  so when I''m\nworking with a clerk,\n\n1166\n01:19:25.429 --> 01:19:28.329\nI want
  the clerk to make\n\n1167\n01:19:28.329 --> 01:19:31.129\nsure there are no\nsurprises.
  Right.\n\n1168\n01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:38.489\nAnd I was pretty\nlucky along the
  way.\n\n1169\n01:19:38.489 --> 01:19:42.969\nAnd bunch of great writers\nyourself
  included.\n\n1170\n01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:46.789\nHard workers curiosity,\nyou fit
  the bill nicely.\n\n1171\n01:19:46.789 --> 01:19:52.689\nWell, it''s I always\ntalk
  about too.\n\n1172\n01:19:52.689 --> 01:19:54.410\nIt''s one of those\nincredible
  experiences\n\n1173\n01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:55.869\nwhere you get out of law school.\n\n1174\n01:19:55.869
  --> 01:19:58.009\nAnd then the work in many ways,\n\n1175\n01:19:58.009 --> 01:20:00.149\nit
  feels like some of\n\n1176\n01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:01.529\nthe most important\nwork
  that you''ll\n\n1177\n01:20:01.529 --> 01:20:03.829\ndo as an attorney\nworking
  on the court.\n\n1178\n01:20:03.829 --> 01:20:07.729\nSo pretty incredible experience.\n\n1179\n01:20:09.970
  --> 01:20:15.089\nSo talk about I recall in\nthe year in your office.\n\n1180\n01:20:15.089
  --> 01:20:16.269\nI should also note.\n\n1181\n01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:17.469\nYeah.\n\n1182\n01:20:19.270
  --> 01:20:22.949\nI wanted diversity in my clerks.\n\n1183\n01:20:22.949 --> 01:20:23.929\nYeah.\n\n1184\n01:20:23.929
  --> 01:20:29.349\nI wanted women. I wanted clerks\nwho were people of color.\n\n1185\n01:20:29.349
  --> 01:20:32.829\nI wanted diversity\nin their, you know,\n\n1186\n01:20:32.829
  --> 01:20:39.949\nwhere they came from, what\ntheir experiences were.\n\n1187\n01:20:39.949
  --> 01:20:42.809\nBecause all of that\n\n1188\n01:20:42.809 --> 01:20:48.349\nmakes
  all of that\nenriches the process.\n\n1189\n01:20:48.349 --> 01:20:57.139\nYeah.
  And makes what I\ndo as a judge better,\n\n1190\n01:20:57.139 --> 01:21:04.359\nhaving
  different views,\nways of looking at things.\n\n1191\n01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:07.859\nAnd
  I mean, I think\nthat''s vital.\n\n1192\n01:21:07.859 --> 01:21:17.579\nYeah. Your
  approach to\ntackling an opinion?\n\n1193\n01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:23.419\nI remember
  You taking\nI think a lot of\n\n1194\n01:21:23.419 --> 01:21:30.620\njoy in peeling
  apart the\nlayers, finding the resolution.\n\n1195\n01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.059\nAnd
  obviously, as you''ve\nsaid many times before,\n\n1196\n01:21:33.059 --> 01:21:34.699\nnone
  of the cases\nthat come before\n\n1197\n01:21:34.699 --> 01:21:37.599\nthe Minnesota
  Supreme\nCourt are simple.\n\n1198\n01:21:37.599 --> 01:21:38.119\nNo.\n\n1199\n01:21:38.119
  --> 01:21:39.679\nThey''re there because\nthey''re complex.\n\n1200\n01:21:39.679
  --> 01:21:41.119\nTalk about a bit.\n\n1201\n01:21:41.119 --> 01:21:43.419\nThey''re
  there because\nthey''re complex.\n\n1202\n01:21:43.419 --> 01:21:45.559\nThey''re
  there because they''re\n\n1203\n01:21:45.559 --> 01:21:48.079\nimportant to the
  people\ninvolved in them.\n\n1204\n01:21:48.079 --> 01:21:50.379\nRight? No matter
  who they are,\n\n1205\n01:21:50.379 --> 01:21:59.999\nwhether it''s the\n\n1206\n01:21:59.999
  --> 01:22:02.099\nfifth petition\n\n1207\n01:22:02.099 --> 01:22:11.399\nfor review
  from a post\nconviction inmate?\n\n1208\n01:22:11.399 --> 01:22:17.000\nOr, you
  know, some\nlarge corporation.\n\n1209\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.819\nIt''s important
  to\nit''s important to\n\n1210\n01:22:19.819 --> 01:22:23.119\nthe people that we
  serve.\n\n1211\n01:22:23.119 --> 01:22:25.359\nIt''s important to the\npeople of
  the state.\n\n1212\n01:22:25.359 --> 01:22:30.499\nYeah. That we do\n\n1213\n01:22:30.499
  --> 01:22:37.279\nit well and that we do\nit as right as we can.\n\n1214\n01:22:38.000
  --> 01:22:45.989\nAnd I Opinion writing\n\n1215\n01:22:45.989 --> 01:22:51.809\nis
  on any given day,\n\n1216\n01:22:51.809 --> 01:22:54.669\nI will tell you that\nit''s
  more art than\n\n1217\n01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:58.989\nscience or that it''s\nmore
  science than art.\n\n1218\n01:22:58.989 --> 01:23:00.369\nRight.\n\n1219\n01:23:00.370
  --> 01:23:04.009\nIt''s really a\ncombination of both.\n\n1220\n01:23:10.970 -->
  01:23:20.369\nFor me, it was very\nimportant to work with\n\n1221\n01:23:20.369
  --> 01:23:30.529\nthe words so that what the\nopinion said was clear,\n\n1222\n01:23:30.730
  --> 01:23:38.829\neasily understood, easily\nread, and helpful.\n\n1223\n01:23:38.829
  --> 01:23:44.979\nYeah. And to do that for me,\n\n1224\n01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:50.819\nit
  was about making sure\n\n1225\n01:23:50.819 --> 01:23:58.119\nthat there were no\nunintended
  words,\n\n1226\n01:23:58.119 --> 01:24:01.719\nmuch less unintended ideas,\n\n1227\n01:24:02.200
  --> 01:24:04.859\nbut no unintended words\n\n1228\n01:24:04.859 --> 01:24:08.719\nthat
  every word\nwas thought about.\n\n1229\n01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:18.359\nPardon me.
  That every\nword was where it was\n\n1230\n01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:24.809\nin the
  sentence because that''s\n\n1231\n01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:27.689\nthe best use of
  the word in\n\n1232\n01:24:27.689 --> 01:24:30.350\ncommunicating the idea that\nyou''re
  trying to communicate?\n\n1233\n01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:32.569\nYeah. That every
  sentence in\n\n1234\n01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:35.529\nthe paragraph was where it was,\n\n1235\n01:24:35.529
  --> 01:24:39.949\nbecause that was the best way\n\n1236\n01:24:39.949 --> 01:24:41.429\nto
  communicate what\nyou were trying\n\n1237\n01:24:41.429 --> 01:24:43.189\nto communicate
  in the paragraph.\n\n1238\n01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:47.609\nThat every paragraph in
  the\nopinion was where it was,\n\n1239\n01:24:47.609 --> 01:24:56.469\nbecause that''s
  where it was\nmost helpful. I suspect that\n\n1240\n01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:03.160\nYou
  clerks probably thought\nI was a little obsessive.\n\n1241\n01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.840\nAnd
  maybe even a\nlittle compulsive,\n\n1242\n01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.299\nbut certainly
  obsessive\nabout words. How we Yeah.\n\n1243\n01:25:15.299 --> 01:25:17.799\nHow
  we used the language.\n\n1244\n01:25:17.799 --> 01:25:20.579\nBut that was important
  to me.\n\n1245\n01:25:20.579 --> 01:25:24.499\nThat was very important to me.\n\n1246\n01:25:24.499
  --> 01:25:26.039\nI remember you\ntalking right away\n\n1247\n01:25:26.039 --> 01:25:28.079\nabout
  the purpose of every word.\n\n1248\n01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:30.559\nIt doesn''t have
  a\nrole that''s not there\n\n1249\n01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:33.419\nfor a reason.
  Gone. Get it out.\n\n1250\n01:25:33.419 --> 01:25:38.249\nNo. I mean, If it\ndoesn''t
  have a reason,\n\n1251\n01:25:38.249 --> 01:25:39.649\nit''s not helping anybody.\n\n1252\n01:25:39.649
  --> 01:25:41.669\nYeah. All it does\n\n1253\n01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:47.049\nis add
  length and the\npotential for confusion.\n\n1254\n01:25:47.049 --> 01:25:50.090\nAnd
  the potential\nfor interpretation\n\n1255\n01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:53.749\ndifferently
  than the\nintended what you intended.\n\n1256\n01:25:53.749 --> 01:25:57.109\nRight.
  Right. I\nremember that lesson.\n\n1257\n01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:59.389\nThat sticks
  with me for sure.\n\n1258\n01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.739\nI was always struck with\n\n1259\n01:26:04.739
  --> 01:26:06.779\nthe collegiality and\nrapport on the court.\n\n1260\n01:26:06.779
  --> 01:26:09.739\nYou know, it was\na serious place,\n\n1261\n01:26:09.739 --> 01:26:11.779\nand
  a lot of important work,\n\n1262\n01:26:11.779 --> 01:26:15.659\nbut I also remember\nat
  least feeling\n\n1263\n01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:18.319\nlike the justices had a lot
  of\n\n1264\n01:26:18.319 --> 01:26:21.199\nrespect for one another and\nwere good
  friends as well.\n\n1265\n01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:22.879\nCan you speak to\nthat
  a little bit?\n\n1266\n01:26:22.879 --> 01:26:26.200\nWell, you know,\nit''s interesting.\n\n1267\n01:26:26.200
  --> 01:26:31.819\nYou have seven people and\nchanging all the time.\n\n1268\n01:26:31.819
  --> 01:26:39.799\nMh. Who have big brains.\n\n1269\n01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.499\nWho
  would like to think they''re\n\n1270\n01:26:42.499 --> 01:26:44.719\nthe smartest
  one in the room,\n\n1271\n01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:55.319\nwho have views that conflict
  and\n\n1272\n01:26:55.319 --> 01:27:02.579\nwho feel\n\n1273\n01:27:02.579 --> 01:27:06.519\nstrongly
  about their opinions.\n\n1274\n01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.939\nBut we''ve been lucky
  here in\n\n1275\n01:27:11.939 --> 01:27:17.020\nMinnesota to have\npeople understand\n\n1276\n01:27:17.020
  --> 01:27:25.379\nthat the\n\n1277\n01:27:25.379 --> 01:27:27.879\ninstitution is\n\n1278\n01:27:27.879
  --> 01:27:30.539\nmore important than\nany one of us.\n\n1279\n01:27:30.700 -->
  01:27:33.880\nAnd institutionally,\n\n1280\n01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:39.220\nit is
  important to maintain\nthat collegiality.\n\n1281\n01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:48.689\nMm.
  Even when you\ncolleagues, in your view,\n\n1282\n01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:53.149\nare
  so far wrong that you\n\n1283\n01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:59.309\ncan''t understand
  how they\ncould poly possibly be there.\n\n1284\n01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:08.509\nAnd
  sometimes the\ntension is pretty high.\n\n1285\n01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:11.569\nBut
  in the end, you\nhave to understand\n\n1286\n01:28:11.569 --> 01:28:16.430\nthat
  it''s about the institution\n\n1287\n01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:18.269\nand the work.
  It''s not about me.\n\n1288\n01:28:18.269 --> 01:28:19.469\nRight.\n\n1289\n01:28:19.469
  --> 01:28:25.009\nAnd also you have\nto understand that\n\n1290\n01:28:25.009 -->
  01:28:29.649\nsomeday You may need\n\n1291\n01:28:29.649 --> 01:28:35.789\nthat
  colleague to get\nwhere you want to go.\n\n1292\n01:28:35.789 --> 01:28:37.969\nSure.
  In a particular case,\n\n1293\n01:28:37.969 --> 01:28:40.289\nwhere you think a\ncase
  should go?\n\n1294\n01:28:40.289 --> 01:28:43.589\nI when I first got on the court,\n\n1295\n01:28:43.589
  --> 01:28:45.989\nI would hear these stories\nabout what was going on\n\n1296\n01:28:45.989
  --> 01:28:51.589\nin other states with\ntheir Supreme Courts.\n\n1297\n01:28:52.030
  --> 01:28:58.649\nJustices inviting one another\n\n1298\n01:28:58.649 --> 01:29:01.789\nout
  into the court\nor to have a fight.\n\n1299\n01:29:01.789 --> 01:29:08.299\nYeah.
  Justices showing up\n\n1300\n01:29:08.299 --> 01:29:12.239\nat conference and placing\n\n1301\n01:29:12.239
  --> 01:29:15.739\nthe handgun on the\nconference table.\n\n1302\n01:29:20.180 -->
  01:29:28.099\nHow does that work? How can\nyou have a justice system\n\n1303\n01:29:33.940
  --> 01:29:40.639\nthat or that\n\n1304\n01:29:40.639 --> 01:29:47.639\nthe the members\n\n1305\n01:29:47.639
  --> 01:29:51.959\nof which of their courts are so\n\n1306\n01:29:51.959 --> 01:29:58.059\nantagonistic
  with one another\nthat they can''t be civil.\n\n1307\n01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:06.019\nEven,
  you know, under pressure.\n\n1308\n01:30:06.019 --> 01:30:09.779\nHow do you reach
  good\ndecisions doing that?\n\n1309\n01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:15.659\nYeah. I don''t
  think you\ncan. One of the things that\n\n1310\n01:30:19.450 --> 01:30:22.189\nThat
  was also, I\nthink, important for\n\n1311\n01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:26.609\nour court
  during\nmy time there to\n\n1312\n01:30:26.609 --> 01:30:33.369\nensure the understanding
  that\n\n1313\n01:30:33.369 --> 01:30:36.409\nColegiality was important and\n\n1314\n01:30:36.409
  --> 01:30:39.309\nthat it''s the\ninstitution, it''s not us.\n\n1315\n01:30:39.750
  --> 01:30:45.289\nWas it we in our conference.\n\n1316\n01:30:45.289 --> 01:30:47.349\nYou
  know, there are seven of us.\n\n1317\n01:30:47.349 --> 01:30:50.269\nWe know each
  other\nby first name.\n\n1318\n01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:55.189\nWe refer to each other\nas
  justice so and so.\n\n1319\n01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:57.629\nJust to make it clear
  in\n\n1320\n01:30:57.629 --> 01:31:00.689\nour own minds and\neverybody else in
  the room\n\n1321\n01:31:00.689 --> 01:31:08.519\nthat This is an institutional\ndecision
  we''re making.\n\n1322\n01:31:08.519 --> 01:31:11.979\nThis is the institution\nthat
  is acting.\n\n1323\n01:31:11.979 --> 01:31:15.119\nIt''s not me, Alan Paige,\nmaking
  a decision.\n\n1324\n01:31:15.119 --> 01:31:21.000\nRight. I''m making it on\nbehalf
  of this institution.\n\n1325\n01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.479\nAnd you know, and it''s
  a way to\n\n1326\n01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.739\nsort of force you to treat\npeople
  with respect?\n\n1327\n01:31:26.739 --> 01:31:27.819\nSure.\n\n1328\n01:31:27.819
  --> 01:31:31.839\nAnd I think it served us well.\n\n1329\n01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:35.519\nThose
  small things\nare not small things.\n\n1330\n01:31:35.519 --> 01:31:37.719\nThey''re
  not not small at all.\n\n1331\n01:31:37.719 --> 01:31:40.879\nRight. Not small at
  all. Right.\n\n1332\n01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:48.769\nYou talk a little\nbit about
  you know,\n\n1333\n01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:51.909\nthe first of the critical first\n\n1334\n01:31:51.909
  --> 01:31:53.049\nof being the first African\n\n1335\n01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.649\nAmerican
  Minnesota\nSupreme Court Justice.\n\n1336\n01:31:55.649 --> 01:31:58.309\nJust sort
  of looking\nback and thinking\n\n1337\n01:31:58.309 --> 01:32:01.769\nabout the
  role of that first\nin your work on the court.\n\n1338\n01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:10.589\nI
  have a hard time doing that\n\n1339\n01:32:10.589 --> 01:32:15.529\nbecause that
  wasn''t\nwhat it was about.\n\n1340\n01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.849\nYeah.\n\n1341\n01:32:17.930
  --> 01:32:21.249\nInstitutionally, I\nthink it''s important.\n\n1342\n01:32:21.249
  --> 01:32:27.849\nThat there had to be a first.\n\n1343\n01:32:27.849 --> 01:32:29.169\nRight?\n\n1344\n01:32:31.250
  --> 01:32:33.829\nInstitutionally,\nit would have been\n\n1345\n01:32:33.829 -->
  01:32:37.409\nbetter had it been\nsomebody long before me.\n\n1346\n01:32:37.409
  --> 01:32:42.809\nYeah. The fact that it finally\n\n1347\n01:32:42.809 --> 01:32:49.389\nhappened
  that\n\n1348\n01:32:49.389 --> 01:32:54.809\nwe finally opened the door,\n\n1349\n01:32:54.809
  --> 01:32:57.569\nif you will, for\npeople of color.\n\n1350\n01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.020\nI
  think it was very significant.\n\n1351\n01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:07.379\nYeah. I think
  equally\nsignificant was the fact\n\n1352\n01:33:07.379 --> 01:33:12.539\nthat when
  I joined the court,\n\n1353\n01:33:12.539 --> 01:33:15.799\nthe court was a\nmajority
  of women.\n\n1354\n01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:17.599\nThat''s right.\n\n1355\n01:33:18.280
  --> 01:33:21.499\nPeople would ask me, what''s it\n\n1356\n01:33:21.499 --> 01:33:24.959\nlike
  serving on a court with\na majority of women, right?\n\n1357\n01:33:24.959 --> 01:33:27.839\nAnd
  of course, having not served\n\n1358\n01:33:27.839 --> 01:33:30.439\non a court
  that wasn''t\na majority of women,\n\n1359\n01:33:30.439 --> 01:33:34.119\nI thought
  wasn''t a\nnatural order of things.\n\n1360\n01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.419\nBut
  those things are important.\n\n1361\n01:33:39.419 --> 01:33:47.819\nYeah. That judicial
  that people\n\n1362\n01:33:47.819 --> 01:33:53.079\nwho serve in our judicial system\n\n1363\n01:33:53.280
  --> 01:33:57.439\nreflect the people\nof this state.\n\n1364\n01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:09.609\nI''ve
  said many times\nthat the only power\n\n1365\n01:34:09.609 --> 01:34:14.869\nthat
  courts have is\n\n1366\n01:34:14.869 --> 01:34:19.749\nfound in the trust and confidence\nof
  the people we serve.\n\n1367\n01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:29.299\nAnd the less the members\n\n1368\n01:34:29.299
  --> 01:34:33.339\nof the judiciary look like\nthe people they serve,\n\n1369\n01:34:33.339
  --> 01:34:38.719\nthe less trust and confidence\nour judiciary will have.\n\n1370\n01:34:38.719
  --> 01:34:44.119\nRight. And so I\n\n1371\n01:34:44.119 --> 01:34:50.799\nthink
  finally\nbreaking that barrier\n\n1372\n01:34:50.799 --> 01:34:53.959\nwas critically
  important. Right.\n\n1373\n01:34:57.970 --> 01:35:00.989\nOn that note, I mean,\n\n1374\n01:35:00.989
  --> 01:35:04.209\nearly on in your\ntenure as a justice,\n\n1375\n01:35:04.209 -->
  01:35:05.889\nand I want to get this right,\n\n1376\n01:35:05.889 --> 01:35:09.349\nyour
  service on the Minnesota\nSupreme Court Task Force\n\n1377\n01:35:09.349 --> 01:35:11.429\non
  racial bias in\nthe Judicial system.\n\n1378\n01:35:11.429 --> 01:35:14.090\nYes.
  Reports issued in 1993.\n\n1379\n01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:16.209\nSix months after
  I\njoined the court?\n\n1380\n01:35:16.209 --> 01:35:17.869\nRight. And you were
  involved.\n\n1381\n01:35:17.869 --> 01:35:20.829\nCan you Well, I can you\ndescribe
  that a little bit,\n\n1382\n01:35:20.829 --> 01:35:22.750\nor what was what was\nyour
  participation?\n\n1383\n01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:23.909\nWhat was your experience?\n\n1384\n01:35:23.909
  --> 01:35:27.109\nI I became the chair of\n\n1385\n01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:31.249\nthe
  committee that was\ngoing to implement.\n\n1386\n01:35:31.249 --> 01:35:35.009\nRight.
  The taskforce Report.\n\n1387\n01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:46.249\nThat was challenging
  for me.\n\n1388\n01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:49.849\nRemember, my interest in\n\n1389\n01:35:49.849
  --> 01:35:56.210\nthe law was the law and not\nin being an administrative?\n\n1390\n01:35:56.210
  --> 01:36:01.109\nRight. And so from\nthat standpoint, Yeah.\n\n1391\n01:36:01.109
  --> 01:36:04.909\nOne of the things that\nnot only that committee,\n\n1392\n01:36:04.909
  --> 01:36:09.970\nbut all we had various\ncommittee assignments.\n\n1393\n01:36:12.340
  --> 01:36:15.920\nI have to say those\ncommittee assignments\n\n1394\n01:36:15.920
  --> 01:36:20.819\nwere not my favorite part\nof being on the court.\n\n1395\n01:36:20.819
  --> 01:36:25.179\nSure. But this was an\nimportant one. Mm hm.\n\n1396\n01:36:25.179
  --> 01:36:28.179\nAnd, you know, we ended\n\n1397\n01:36:28.179 --> 01:36:37.859\nup
  working through the depending\non how you count them,\n\n1398\n01:36:37.859 -->
  01:36:42.220\nthe hundred plus\nrecommendations.\n\n1399\n01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:47.820\nPretty
  much most of\nthem being implemented.\n\n1400\n01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.739\nBut\n\n1401\n01:36:59.270
  --> 01:37:00.389\nand\n\n1402\n01:37:00.389 --> 01:37:08.209\nthe implementation\nmade
  things better,\n\n1403\n01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:11.109\nbut it didn''t solve the
  problem.\n\n1404\n01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:13.509\nRight. It was a little\n\n1405\n01:37:22.250
  --> 01:37:27.229\nI think we made very\nincremental progress.\n\n1406\n01:37:27.229
  --> 01:37:32.369\nThe disparities that\ncame out of the report,\n\n1407\n01:37:32.530
  --> 01:37:36.109\nparticularly in the\ncriminal justice area,\n\n1408\n01:37:36.109
  --> 01:37:42.130\nwhere African Americans,\n\n1409\n01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:47.849\npeople
  of color arrest stopped,\n\n1410\n01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:55.929\ncharged given higher
  bail.\n\n1411\n01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:02.059\nLess fair trials, higher\nconviction
  rates,\n\n1412\n01:38:02.059 --> 01:38:06.799\nlonger sentences, all\nthings being
  equal.\n\n1413\n01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.619\nThat hasn''t that hasn''t ended.\n\n1414\n01:38:11.619
  --> 01:38:14.559\nAnd that''s just on the\ncriminal justice side.\n\n1415\n01:38:14.559
  --> 01:38:16.159\nThere''s the juvenile justice\n\n1416\n01:38:16.159 --> 01:38:19.799\nand
  all the other\naspects of the report.\n\n1417\n01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.799\nI''ve
  more or less come\nto the conclusion\n\n1418\n01:38:23.799 --> 01:38:31.809\nthat
  before real change\nis going to happen.\n\n1419\n01:38:31.809 --> 01:38:38.429\nWe
  have to take\n\n1420\n01:38:38.429 --> 01:38:46.269\na more fundamental look at\nwhat
  our law is grounded in.\n\n1421\n01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:54.350\nWhich is to say,
  it''s\ngrounded in a constitution\n\n1422\n01:38:54.350 --> 01:39:03.249\nthat counted
  those imported\n\n1423\n01:39:03.249 --> 01:39:06.209\nas slaves as three\nfifths
  of person.\n\n1424\n01:39:06.970 --> 01:39:09.149\nAnd while we''ve had\n\n1425\n01:39:09.149
  --> 01:39:19.289\nthe 13th 14th and 15th\namendments ending slavery,\n\n1426\n01:39:19.289
  --> 01:39:27.449\nensuring due process and\n\n1427\n01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:33.729\nguaranteeing
  the right to vote\n\n1428\n01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:40.159\nThe law itself the\nfoundation
  is still on\n\n1429\n01:39:40.159 --> 01:39:43.959\ncases that arose out of slavery.\n\n1430\n01:39:43.959
  --> 01:39:47.899\nRight. And we''ve got\nto figure out how to\n\n1431\n01:39:48.100
  --> 01:39:55.139\ntease that out of it before\nwe have fundamental change.\n\n1432\n01:39:55.139
  --> 01:39:57.619\nStructural fundamental\nchange. Yeah. Right.\n\n1433\n01:39:57.619
  --> 01:40:04.459\nIt''s at systemic problem.\n\n1434\n01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:12.989\nWhat
  about Justice Page,\n\n1435\n01:40:12.989 --> 01:40:18.789\nany notable opinions,
  dissents,\n\n1436\n01:40:18.789 --> 01:40:22.889\nAnything come to mind.\nYou wrote
  a lot.\n\n1437\n01:40:22.889 --> 01:40:24.309\nSo it''s a big body of work,\n\n1438\n01:40:24.309
  --> 01:40:25.469\nbut\n\n1439\n01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:35.759\nI I have\n\n1440\n01:40:35.759
  --> 01:40:40.239\nnever in my own head,\n\n1441\n01:40:40.239 --> 01:40:45.479\nquantified
  or qualified,\nwhether it was\n\n1442\n01:40:45.479 --> 01:40:51.779\na dissent
  or an opinion in\nterms of its importance.\n\n1443\n01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:55.499\nBecause
  it seems to me\nthat once you do that,\n\n1444\n01:40:55.499 --> 01:40:59.059\nonce
  you decide that this one\n\n1445\n01:40:59.059 --> 01:41:01.359\nis more important
  than that one,\n\n1446\n01:41:01.359 --> 01:41:05.160\nyou start doing both\nof
  them a disservice.\n\n1447\n01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.819\nAnd so I took each one
  as they\n\n1448\n01:41:08.819 --> 01:41:12.899\ncame and tried to put the same\n\n1449\n01:41:14.900
  --> 01:41:21.719\nEnergy and effort into\ntrying to get it right.\n\n1450\n01:41:21.719
  --> 01:41:24.859\nYeah. And again, as I say,\n\n1451\n01:41:24.859 --> 01:41:30.899\nwhether
  it was that fifth\npost conviction petition or,\n\n1452\n01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:40.379\nyou
  know, some mega million\ndollar corporate issue.\n\n1453\n01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.019\nThe
  people who come before\n\n1454\n01:41:46.019 --> 01:41:50.679\nus deserve to have\nour
  fulest attention.\n\n1455\n01:41:50.679 --> 01:41:54.999\nMm hmm. And so\n\n1456\n01:41:54.999
  --> 01:41:57.399\nI just don''t qualify him and\n\n1457\n01:41:57.399 --> 01:42:00.819\nquantify
  him that way.\nThink of it as that, right?\n\n1458\n01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:08.729\nSo
  during your\ntenure in the court,\n\n1459\n01:42:08.729 --> 01:42:10.889\none thing
  I wanted to ask\nyou about too is just\n\n1460\n01:42:10.889 --> 01:42:14.809\nsort
  of the interplay,\n\n1461\n01:42:14.809 --> 01:42:18.389\nif you think of there
  being\none at all between your kind\n\n1462\n01:42:18.389 --> 01:42:20.069\nof continued\ncommunity
  engagement\n\n1463\n01:42:20.069 --> 01:42:21.529\nand still working on the court.\n\n1464\n01:42:21.529
  --> 01:42:23.729\nYou know, we would I\nthink back a lot on\n\n1465\n01:42:23.729
  --> 01:42:26.429\ngoing and reading with you\n\n1466\n01:42:26.429 --> 01:42:28.869\nand
  other staff in\nthe court reading to\n\n1467\n01:42:28.869 --> 01:42:30.189\nelementary
  school kids on\n\n1468\n01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:32.669\nWednesdays or\nwhatever day
  it was.\n\n1469\n01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:38.109\nThat community\nengagement and You
  know,\n\n1470\n01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:40.949\ndid that play a role in\nyour work
  as a justice?\n\n1471\n01:42:40.949 --> 01:42:42.849\nDid you see it\nsort of separately\n\n1472\n01:42:42.849
  --> 01:42:46.649\nor was it related and\ndidn''t inform your work?\n\n1473\n01:42:46.649
  --> 01:42:49.029\nOh, I think everything we do,\n\n1474\n01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:51.909\nour
  lives inform our work.\n\n1475\n01:42:51.909 --> 01:42:56.609\nI don''t know that
  I, you know,\n\n1476\n01:42:56.609 --> 01:42:59.029\nreading with kids\nor my involvement\n\n1477\n01:42:59.029
  --> 01:43:00.849\nto the extent that I had it,\n\n1478\n01:43:00.849 --> 01:43:02.809\nwhich
  was quite limited, right?\n\n1479\n01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:05.429\nThe Page Education
  Foundation.\n\n1480\n01:43:06.630 --> 01:43:09.469\nInfluenced my work directly.\n\n1481\n01:43:09.469
  --> 01:43:11.129\nBut it''s a part of who I am.\n\n1482\n01:43:11.129 --> 01:43:20.049\nRight.
  And being engaged in\nthe community around us at\n\n1483\n01:43:20.049 --> 01:43:22.269\nsome
  level helps us\n\n1484\n01:43:22.269 --> 01:43:31.329\nunderstand those people\nwe
  are a part of,\n\n1485\n01:43:31.329 --> 01:43:32.849\nbut also who we represent.\n\n1486\n01:43:32.849
  --> 01:43:34.269\nMm hm.\n\n1487\n01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:40.989\nAnd I think it\n\n1488\n01:43:40.989
  --> 01:43:42.289\nwould be a mistake to be\n\n1489\n01:43:42.289 --> 01:43:46.509\nisolated
  and not a part\nof the world around us.\n\n1490\n01:43:46.509 --> 01:43:49.649\nYeah.
  To the extent obviously,\n\n1491\n01:43:49.649 --> 01:43:50.889\nto the extent possible.\n\n1492\n01:43:50.889
  --> 01:43:54.790\nYeah. To the extent that it\ndoesn''t create conflicts.\n\n1493\n01:43:54.790
  --> 01:44:04.189\nYeah. You''ve had some\ntime now after retiring,\n\n1494\n01:44:04.189
  --> 01:44:11.069\nI suppose to think\nback any Well,\n\n1495\n01:44:11.069 --> 01:44:15.549\nIs
  I guess maybe the question\nis in thinking about it.\n\n1496\n01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:18.430\nThis
  kind of gets to maybe\nsome final reflections\n\n1497\n01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:20.589\nabout
  your time on the court.\n\n1498\n01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:23.609\nIt''s a big question,\nbut
  what is it you\n\n1499\n01:44:23.609 --> 01:44:26.350\nknow, personally\nand professionally?\n\n1500\n01:44:26.350
  --> 01:44:30.629\nCan you put into words what\nthe service meant to you?\n\n1501\n01:44:33.030
  --> 01:44:35.569\nWell, for me, it was the most\n\n1502\n01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:37.949\nin
  terms of my\nprofessional life,\n\n1503\n01:44:37.949 --> 01:44:41.109\nthe most
  fulfilling\nthing I''ve ever done.\n\n1504\n01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:50.469\nThe challenges
  of working\nwith seven other people.\n\n1505\n01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:57.459\nI mean,
  I looked\n\n1506\n01:44:57.459 --> 01:45:00.039\nforward every day when\nI was on
  the court.\n\n1507\n01:45:00.039 --> 01:45:03.579\nParticularly to\nthose days where
  we\n\n1508\n01:45:03.579 --> 01:45:07.600\nwould hear argument\nand have conferences,\n\n1509\n01:45:07.600
  --> 01:45:14.979\nbecause every conference,\nyou got stretched in ways\n\n1510\n01:45:14.979
  --> 01:45:22.919\nthat You would never You\nwould never get stretched.\n\n1511\n01:45:22.919
  --> 01:45:26.299\nAnd I love that.\n\n1512\n01:45:26.299 --> 01:45:29.099\nTrying
  to understand what\n\n1513\n01:45:29.099 --> 01:45:31.699\nyour colleagues are\nsaying
  and thinking,\n\n1514\n01:45:31.699 --> 01:45:34.319\ntrying to understand\nwhat
  you''re thinking in\n\n1515\n01:45:34.319 --> 01:45:36.799\nthe context of what
  they''re\nsaying and thinking,\n\n1516\n01:45:36.799 --> 01:45:39.359\nand trying
  to understand\nwhat you''re thinking.\n\n1517\n01:45:39.359 --> 01:45:41.799\nYour
  thought process is, right?\n\n1518\n01:45:41.799 --> 01:45:47.579\nAnd working through
  all that.\nDoesn''t get any better.\n\n1519\n01:45:47.579 --> 01:45:50.479\nSometimes
  arriving\nat unexpected places\n\n1520\n01:45:50.479 --> 01:45:52.079\ntoo. All
  the time.\n\n1521\n01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:58.839\nAll the time. Arriving\nat expected
  places,\n\n1522\n01:45:58.839 --> 01:46:02.199\narriving at places that\non a personal
  level,\n\n1523\n01:46:02.199 --> 01:46:04.479\nyou wouldn''t want to arrive at.\n\n1524\n01:46:04.479
  --> 01:46:09.639\nYou would. If I could\ndecide this on my own,\n\n1525\n01:46:09.639
  --> 01:46:16.319\nI would not this is\nnot what I would do.\n\n1526\n01:46:16.319
  --> 01:46:17.099\nYeah.\n\n1527\n01:46:17.099 --> 01:46:21.579\nBut not my choice.
  You know,\n\n1528\n01:46:24.210 --> 01:46:29.549\nOne of the a\n\n1529\n01:46:29.549
  --> 01:46:34.929\nlittle bit disconcerting\nthings about our society.\n\n1530\n01:46:35.170
  --> 01:46:45.969\nI don''t think people understand\nhow important it is for\n\n1531\n01:46:45.969
  --> 01:46:51.629\njudges to be impartial and\n\n1532\n01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:59.609\nto
  exercise their judgment\nand not impose their will.\n\n1533\n01:46:59.609 --> 01:47:06.039\nMm
  hmm. And just the challenge\n\n1534\n01:47:06.039 --> 01:47:07.439\nof doing that
  all the time.\n\n1535\n01:47:07.439 --> 01:47:08.359\nYeah.\n\n1536\n01:47:08.359
  --> 01:47:11.139\nAnd trying to get that right.\n\n1537\n01:47:11.139 --> 01:47:17.159\nIt''s
  all very very much fun.\n\n1538\n01:47:17.159 --> 01:47:25.340\nYeah. Very invigorating,\nvery
  satisfying.\n\n1539\n01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.499\nYeah.\n\n1540\n01:47:28.580
  --> 01:47:32.379\nAnd hopefully in the end,\n\n1541\n01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:43.389\nI
  did it as well\nas I could do it.\n\n1542\n01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:47.469\nLeave
  that up to to\nothers to decide.\n\n1543\n01:47:47.469 --> 01:47:54.229\nSure. But
  that was\ncertainly my goal.\n\n1544\n01:47:54.229 --> 01:48:02.149\nYeah. And I
  enjoyed every\nminute of it along the way.\n\n1545\n01:48:03.690 --> 01:48:06.409\nWhat
  about the\nfuture of the court?\n\n1546\n01:48:06.409 --> 01:48:09.049\nYou''re
  not on it,\nobviously anymore,\n\n1547\n01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:13.969\nbut thinking
  about\nchallenges. Hopes.\n\n1548\n01:48:13.969 --> 01:48:16.349\nAny thoughts come\nto
  mind about Well,\n\n1549\n01:48:16.349 --> 01:48:20.510\nMy hope would be that they\ncontinue
  to be independent,\n\n1550\n01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:27.249\nthat they continue to
  act\n\n1551\n01:48:27.249 --> 01:48:32.409\nimpartially and understand that\n\n1552\n01:48:32.570
  --> 01:48:36.409\nit is about the\nexercise of judgment.\n\n1553\n01:48:40.220 -->
  01:48:46.599\nAnd if the court''s\nmembers can do that,\n\n1554\n01:48:46.599 -->
  01:48:49.339\nit''ll have a bright future.\n\n1555\n01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.899\nAnd
  there''s something about,\n\n1556\n01:48:54.899 --> 01:48:57.159\nat least from
  my experience on\n\n1557\n01:48:57.159 --> 01:49:01.219\nthe court looking back\nand
  looking forward.\n\n1558\n01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:04.859\nI think there''s a p good
  chance\n\n1559\n01:49:04.859 --> 01:49:11.314\nthat things will continue in\nthat
  regard as they have.\n\n1560\n01:49:11.314 --> 01:49:19.210\nYeah. The Court''s\nleadership
  understands.\n\n1561\n01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:25.629\nI had the good fortune\nto
  serve with.\n\n1562\n01:49:25.629 --> 01:49:28.429\nLet me think. I knew\n\n1563\n01:49:28.429
  --> 01:49:31.609\nthe number exactly at\none time. Let''s see.\n\n1564\n01:49:32.970
  --> 01:49:40.619\nTo I can''t remember\n\n1565\n01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:43.319\nthe
  exact number six or seven\nor eight. Chief Justice.\n\n1566\n01:49:43.319 --> 01:49:46.679\nChef
  Justices. Yeah. And each\n\n1567\n01:49:46.679 --> 01:49:50.979\none of them got
  it. They\nwere all different.\n\n1568\n01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:54.819\nBut each one
  of them\n\n1569\n01:49:55.300 --> 01:50:01.239\nunderstood how important\nit is
  for this for\n\n1570\n01:50:01.239 --> 01:50:04.519\ncourt to maintain\nits independence
  and\n\n1571\n01:50:04.519 --> 01:50:09.620\nits impartiality and\nto make decisions\n\n1572\n01:50:10.300
  --> 01:50:19.619\nbased on the law and\n\n1573\n01:50:19.619 --> 01:50:23.819\nthe
  facts and their\nbest judgment and not\n\n1574\n01:50:23.819 --> 01:50:29.279\non
  the way the wind\nis blowing today.\n\n1575\n01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.879\nWe''ve
  been lucky to have\nreally good people,\n\n1576\n01:50:36.879 --> 01:50:40.299\nboth
  at the Chief Justice as\n\n1577\n01:50:40.299 --> 01:50:44.999\nChief Justices and
  as\nassociate justices.\n\n1578\n01:50:44.999 --> 01:50:51.939\nYeah. And to be\n\n1579\n01:50:51.939
  --> 01:50:55.439\nincluded in that group,\nit''s pretty special.\n\n1580\n01:50:59.840
  --> 01:51:04.759\nYou know, I want to definitely\nbefore we close out,\n\n1581\n01:51:04.759
  --> 01:51:08.859\ngive you an opportunity to\nspeak to your late wife,\n\n1582\n01:51:08.859
  --> 01:51:14.139\nDiane''s role in your career.\n\n1583\n01:51:14.139 --> 01:51:18.579\nWell,
  I mentioned earlier\n\n1584\n01:51:18.579 --> 01:51:26.039\nabout that $40.000 that
  I\nlost on the vending machine.\n\n1585\n01:51:26.039 --> 01:51:28.119\nYeah. That''s
  right.\n\n1586\n01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:31.959\nThe company that\n\n1587\n01:51:33.290
  --> 01:51:35.749\nThat owned the vending machines\n\n1588\n01:51:35.749 --> 01:51:37.669\nwas
  a subsidiary\nof General Mills.\n\n1589\n01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:39.969\nI know where
  this is going now.\n\n1590\n01:51:39.969 --> 01:51:43.389\nAnd long story short?\n\n1591\n01:51:43.389
  --> 01:51:46.349\nYeah. I was in the lobby\nat General Mills one day,\n\n1592\n01:51:46.349
  --> 01:51:48.849\nhaving left the meeting and left\n\n1593\n01:51:48.849 --> 01:51:55.269\nmy

  matter who they were, no\n\n1606\n01:52:42.389 --> 01:52:45.629\nmatter what the\ncircumstances

  those people who\n\n1620\n01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:13.469\nI I have ideas.\n\n1621\n01:54:13.469
  --> 01:54:15.309\nShe was a doer.\n\n1622\n01:54:15.309 --> 01:54:17.010\nExecutor.\n\n1623\n01:54:17.010
  --> 01:54:21.149\nAbsolutely. And it wasn''t,\n\n1624\n01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:26.729\nyou
  know, when are you\ngoing to get this done?\n\n1625\n01:54:26.729 --> 01:54:30.029\nIt''s
  why wasn''t this\ndone yesterday?\n\n1626\n01:54:30.029 --> 01:54:32.269\nWell,
  because we just found\n\n1627\n01:54:32.269 --> 01:54:33.609\nout that we had to
  do it today.\n\n1628\n01:54:33.609 --> 01:54:39.749\nYeah. She was in\n\n1629\n01:54:39.749

  place. That''s for sure.\n\n1632\n01:54:48.249 --> 01:54:54.389\nAnd, M. Got lucky.\n\n1633\n01:54:59.510

  thank you, in thinking\nabout this conversation,\n\n1671\n01:57:11.489 --> 01:57:13.089\nsort
  of the arc from\nthe beginning to end\n\n1672\n01:57:13.089 --> 01:57:15.269\nand
  the focus on the\nMinnesota Supreme Court.\n\n1673\n01:57:15.269 --> 01:57:16.729\nYou

  Supreme Court, too.\n\n1676\n01:57:20.449 --> 01:57:23.789\nWell, thank you for
  that,\n\n1677\n01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:39.339\nI can''t articulate how much I\nloved
  serving on the court.\n\n1678\n01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:45.339\nAnd being able to
  serve\nthe people of this state.\n\n1679\n01:57:45.339 --> 01:57:50.659\nI can''t
  articulate how honored I\n\n1680\n01:57:50.659 --> 01:57:55.499\nam that the people\n\n1681\n01:57:55.499
  --> 01:57:58.779\nof the state gave me the\nopportunity to do it.\n\n1682\n01:58:01.860
  --> 01:58:10.359\nAnd I don''t know.\n\n1683\n01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:22.259\nWell,
  let me just back up.\n\n1684\n01:58:22.259 --> 01:58:33.399\nYou know, one of the
  humbling\nthings about serving.\n\n1685\n01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.979\nYou know,
  you''re there, you''re\n\n1686\n01:58:36.979 --> 01:58:38.999\nworking on cases
  and you''re\n\n1687\n01:58:38.999 --> 01:58:45.039\nlooking at cases from 18 60.\n\n1688\n01:58:48.200
  --> 01:58:54.499\nTrying to figure out\nwhat the law is today.\n\n1689\n01:58:54.499
  --> 01:58:56.659\nBecause it''s grounded in\n\n1690\n01:58:56.659 --> 01:58:59.439\nsomething
  that took\nplace back then.\n\n1691\n01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:08.999\nThe idea that
  cases\nthat I worked\n\n1692\n01:59:08.999 --> 01:59:16.700\non when I was on the\ncourt
  will be used 150,\n\n1693\n01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:18.959\n200 years from now,\n\n1694\n01:59:20.280
  --> 01:59:24.139\nthat the law will be\ngrounded in something that\n\n1695\n01:59:24.139
  --> 01:59:29.479\nI was a part of\nduring my tenure.\n\n1696\n01:59:29.479 --> 01:59:32.720\nIt''s
  almost overwhelming.\n\n1697\n01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:39.199\nIt''s an awesome thought.\n\n1698\n01:59:39.199
  --> 01:59:46.819\nI just I just hope that\nI didn''t goof it up.\n\n1699\n01:59:46.980
  --> 01:59:55.299\nSo that Hopefully, what I\n\n1700\n01:59:55.299 --> 01:59:58.479\ndid
  what we did when I was on\n\n1701\n01:59:58.479 --> 02:00:04.059\nthe court will
  make\ntheir jobs easier. Sure.\n\n1702\n02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:11.099\nA good note
  to end\non. Thank you.\n\n1703\n02:00:11.099 --> 02:00:12.539\nThank you. Appreciate
