  MINNESOTA'S   WAR   HISTORY.
  A great task as well as a great opportunity will confront the future historian of
  this state when he comes to tell the full
  story of Minnesota's participation in the
  World War: how she played her part among
  the free peoples of the world in the fight for
  world freedom; how she furnished thousands of her sons to the fighting forces of
  the nation and how these men conducted
  themselves and what they experienced in
  camp, at sea, and on the field of battle;
  how she stood for loyalty at home and suppressed the Hun within her gates; how she
  readjusted her whole course of life, giving
  abundantly of her means, her substance, her
  thought, her time, her strength, her prayers,
  sacrificing luxuries and making spare use of
  the necessities of life, and, forgetting all
  petty rivalries, united in efforts put forth
  for the winning of the war, for the welfare
  of the fighters, and for the relief of war-
  stricken peoples; and how in other and less
  obvious ways the war altered the direction
  and character of her normal interests and
  pursuits.
  Such a story will constitute a unique and
  important chapter in the history of our
  state.    It  will   be  of interest  not only  to
  3
- |-
  coming generations of Minnesotans, but also
  to us who have lived and worked in these
  stirring times, conscious that we were helping in the accomplishment of great things,
  but too intent upon the performance of our
  own special and more or less limited tasks
  to take a comprehensive view of the course
  of events in our state, and perhaps even in
  our own localities.
  Our War  History  Materials  Should
  Be  Gathered  Now.
  But if Minnesota's war history is to record adequately the achievements of which
  Minnesotans are justly iso proud, -steps must
  be taken, and taken at once, to gather so
  far as possible into public depositories, and
  at least to ensure the preservation of, the
  data, the records, and the relics which will
  be needed for the production of that history
  and which in themselves will be increasingly treasured mementoes of the unprecedented happenings of the days just passing.
  The governments of the European nations
  involved in the great conflict, from the very
  beginning and while actually carrying on
  the struggle, have made provision for the
  immediate and systematic building up of
  war libraries and museums containing every
  conceivable kind of record relating to the
  sacrifices and deeds of their respective peoples. Canada and Canadian provinces have
  done likewise, and since the United States
  entered the war a constantly growing num-
- |-
  ber of states have officially recognized the
  importance of collecting and preserving
  their local war records and have inaugurated statewide movements for the attainment of that end.
  The  Minnesota  War   Records
  Commission.
  With these facts in mind, the governor
  recently appointed a body called the Minnesota War Records Commission, whose duty
  it is to arouse in Minnesota a due appreciation of the value of her war records, to
  point out the great variety and extent of the
  materials which may properly be considered
  "war records," and to organize and direct a
  statewide movement for their collection and
  permanent preservation.
  To fulfill its mission completely, the Commission must look for the voluntary assistance of public spirited citizens in every
  community throughout the state. The general plan is to appoint a local representative, or COUNTY CHAIRMAN, in every
  county, who will organize and direct the
  work of collecting that county's war records.
  In most cases the County Chairman will
  need the help of other local people whom he
  will associate with him as a COUNTY WAR
  RECORDS COMMITTEE, and as local representatives or committees in the outlying
  towns and districts of the county according
  to the particular circumstances. In both
  the work of organization and collection the
- |-
  Commission aims to keep in close touch
  with its County Chairman, offering suggestions and encouragement and receiving reports from time to time on the progress of
  the work.
  The organization of the counties is now
  in progress. The response to the Commission's appeal, together with independent
  suggestions and comment appearing daily
  in the columns of our newspapers, indicates
  that the time is ripe for the launching of a
  "war records drive" in this state. In fact
  the action of the Commission has been anticipated in at least one Minnesota county,
  Freeborn, where the register of deeds on
  his own initiative has for some weeks been
  gathering data on the individual military
  records of the soldiers from that county.
  What Is Meant by War Records.
  Broadly considered, Minnesota'is war records may be held to include all the material,
  of whatever variety of origin, content, or
  form, which in any way relates to the lives
  and deeds of Minnesota men in the military
  service, to the many forms of civilian war
  service performed locally, and to the altered
  course of life in Minnesota communities
  during the war period. The Commission,
  therefore, urges the collection and preservation of the following broad classes of material :
- |-
  1.  Military Service Records.
  Materials relating to the history of military units, training camps and schools
  where Minnesota men have been gathered in numbers.
  Individual records of the men from each
  county in the military service of the
  federal and state governments during
  American participation in the World
  War.
  For compiling these records the Commission has prepared a form of record
  calling for specific information about
  the individual soldier's military career,
  and about his civil status before and
  immediately following his term of service. A copy of this form will be supplied by the Commission for every soldier included in this class.
  Individual records of such men from each
  county as served in the armed forces of
  foreign belligerent nations at any time
  during the World War from its beginning in August, 1914.
  A modification of the above-mentioned
  form will probably be used in compiling
  these records when the number and distribution of these men is ascertained.
  Of equal importance with the compiling of the above formal records is
  the collection of individual and group
  photographs of Minnesota soldiers and
  sailors, their letters from camps and
  from overseas, newspapers and other
  publications issued at camps or by
  units where local men were found in
  numbers, diaries, photographs of military   scenes,   souvenirs,   insignia,   tro-
- |-
  phies, and other ready-made records of
  their life in the service.
  2. Records of the War Services of Individual
  Civilians.
  Individual records of such men and
  women from each county as engaged in
  nonmilitary forms of national or state
  war service outside the county, such as
  work for the Red Cross, Y. M. C. A.,
  Food Administration, or Department of
  Justice.
  A special form may be used in compiling these records when the number
  and distribution of the people in question is  ascertained.
  3. Records of Home Community War Activi
  ties and Conditions.
  Directory of all local agencies and of all
  local branches of state and national
  agencies in each county engaged in war
  activities, including the names and addresses of officers and of leading agents
  or workers, and the names of members
  where practicable.
  In addition to being of historical
  value, such a record will be of immediate service to the war records organization in locating and collecting the
  ready-made records described below.
  Written reports upon the war activities
  of the various local agencies, organizations, and institutionis, and upon the
  progress within the county of the more
  or less informal and slightly organized
  movements of the period, with special
  attention to cases where adequate records of the ready-made variety Indicated
  below are not available.
- |-
  Ready-made records of local activities.
  By "ready-made" records is meant
  that sort of material which is produced
  independently of the war records organization, in connection with the actual conduct of the activities in question. These records have only to be
  gathered or preserved. Following are
  suggestive lists (1) of agencies producing such records and (2) of various
  forms in which they appear. By referring from each item in one list to all
  the items in the other, one may gain a
  working conception of the ready-made
  records to be found in greater or less
  quantity in every community:
  (1)   RECORD PRODUCING AGENCIES.

  Labor organizations
  Farmers' clubs
  Printing shops
  Photographic
  studios
  Banks and trust
  companies
  Business firms
  Factories and mills
  Mining companies
  Public  service  corporations
  Individuals
  In explanation of the comprehensive character of the foregoing list, with special reference to the non-official agencies named,
  it may be pointed out that the records of
  these agencies will be needed for information not only about the part taken by a community in the war, but also about how the
  community was itself affected by wartime
  conditions, with respect to its education, religion, commerce, finance, politics, industry,
  agriculture, living conditions, customs, habits of thought, and other matters of vital
  interest.

  •Some of this material may at first thought
  seem commonplace and even trivial, but
  that that will not be the case fifty or a hundred years from now will be appreciated by
  everyone who reflects upon the interest attaching to the relics of Civil War days and
  of the period of the American Revolution.
  Suggestions for County War  Records
  Committees.
  The Commission makes the following very
  general suggestions for the guidance of the
  county chairmen and committees in organizing the counties and formulating plans of
  campaign at the outset, leaving the details
  of special problems for consideration in circular letters to be issued by the Commission
  from time to time as the work progresses.
  The local committees will at all times, however, be encouraged to apply the suggestions
  of the Commission with whatever modifications the peculiar needs of the local situation may call for. In fact the success of the
  movement will depend very largely upon
  the initiative and resourcefulness shown by
  the local organizations in solving their own
  special problems. The Commission's chief
  concern is the getting of results.
  Personnel of Committees.
  It is suggested that county chairmen include on their committees such people as
  librarians, teachers of history, editors, and
  representatives of leading war agencies including local draft boards.
  12
- |-
  Division of Work.
  The war records work in the county
  should be so divided that each active worker
  have one or more definite tasks to perform.
  A good plan, if enough people can be interested, is to divide the county into sections small enough so that each section can
  be canvassed by one person and to assign to
  some person the responsibility of collecting
  all the varieties of data and records available in that section. This is the method
  used by the "block system" type of organization and is particularly serviceable for
  getting at the sort of data and records to be
  found for the most part in private homes.
  Or the work might be divided on the basis
  of classes of records, distributing among the
  workers the responsibility of compiling the
  data on the war services of individuals and
  of collecting the classes of ready-made records severally designated on page 11 above
  as printed matter, manuscript material, pictorial records, and mementoes.
  Again, in collecting the records of home
  community war activities, each worker
  might be asked to collect all the available
  records relating to the war activities or
  condition of a few specified local agencies,
  organizations, or institutions.
  Other methods, perhaps involving combinations of the foregoing, will suggest
  themselves to the county committees.
  ^3
- |-
  Co-operating Agencies.
  County committees will do well to make
  full use of the special facilities afforded by
  other local organizations and institutions
  such as the local branches of the public
  safety organization, draft boards, commercial clubs, public libraries, schools, churches,
  newspapers, pioneer associations, Red Cross
  and D. A. R. chapters.
  The local newspapers may be of special
  service in giving to the work the publicity
  so essential to any movement depending
  upon the interest and co-operation of large
  numbers of people. The writing of articles
  and notices for publication locally might
  well be made the special business of some
  member of the county committee.
  From local public safety associations,
  county boards, commercial clubs, interested
  individuals, or from other possible sources,
  the county committees ought to be able to
  obtain assistance in defraying such expenses as the successful conduct of the
  work may entail. County committees in
  other states have in many instances been
  thus aided.
  As the Minnesota Public Safety Commission is backing the war records movement,
  its county directors will doubtless co-operate with the local war records committees
  to the extent of their ability.
  14
- |-
  Collection of  Records.
  While the program of the Commission
  calls for the collection of all available war
  records in each county, it is desirable that
  first attention be given to those described
  as follows:
  Military service records of men from each
  county in the service of the federal and
  state governments during American participation in the war (see page 7). The blank
  form supplied by the Commission for the
  records of men of this class should be
  filled out and completed in each case as
  soon as circumstances permit. The desired
  information may be obtained from the
  draft boards, from the families and friends
  of the soldiers, from the soldiers themselves, or from any other reliable source at
  hand.
  Records of special wartime agencies
  which have completed or will soon complete their work. An immediate canvass
  should be made of the situation with respect to the records of these agencies with
  a view of securing samples of every bit of
  printed or other matter issued by them for
  general distribution, and of acquiring, whenever possible, the custody of their office
  files and records.
  Newspapers. The local newspaper is the
  most comprehensive record of local activities and conditions. Files of all newspapers
  published   in  the   county   during    the   war
  IS
- |-
  should therefore be secured. If such files
  are not already on deposit in the libraries
  or other public depositories of the county,
  they should be made up of files or copies
  secured as soon as possible from the publishers, from individuals, or from whatever
  source obtainable. If possible, duplicate
  files should be secured for the purpose of
  clipping and making into scrapbooks the
  articles and items of local war interest.
  Printed and other publicity matter issued
  by all the various local agencies listed
  on pages 9 and 10. Much of this material is
  ephemeral in character and is likely to disappear soon after its momentary practical
  usefulness is over. Early visits to the local
  printing shops, where samples of job work
  are usually allowed to accumulate for some
  time, will probably yield much material of
  this description which has not yet been destroyed. It may also be picked up here and
  there in the community if a careful search
  is made now.
  Photographs and kodak views. Popular
  interest in the war records work may be
  greatly stimulated by the early collection
  and display of pictures illustrative of local
  war activities. Both the professional and
  amateur photographers of the county should
  be urged to contribute such pictures, carefully dated and labelled, to the county war
  collection.
  16
- |-
  Disposition   of  the  War   Records.
  As a general rule the Commission will
  encourage the county committees to use
  such of the records collected by them as
  are chiefly local in character in the building
  up of COUNTY WAR COLLECTIONS, if the
  necessary arrangements can be made for
  their proper care and preservation locally.
  Usually the leading county library, the
  courthouse, or other local depository will
  afford the necessary facilities. The military service records, however, for which
  forms are supplied by the state, are to be
  sent ultimately to the Commission, though
  county committees are urged to provide
  similar records for the county collections.
  There will also be built up a STATE WAR
  COLLECTION composed in general of records relating to the war activities of the
  state as a whole. This collection will include records emanating from the state
  headquarters of the various agencies and
  interests in the state, together with representative material relating to war activities
  and conditions in the several communities
  of the state. County committees are therefore asked to forward to the Commission
  all material secured by them which is of
  more than local significance, or which for
  any other reason should be filed in the main
  collection. The local committees are also
  urged to send to the Commission such duplicate local  material as  may be gathered
  17
- |-
  in the course of building up the county collections. AH records acquired by the Commission will be deposited with the state
  collection already begun by the Minnesota
  Historical Society, in the Historical Building at St. Paul.

  war records, to\npoint out the great variety and extent of the\nmaterials which
  may properly be considered\n\"war records,\" and to organize and direct a\nstatewide
  movement for their collection and\npermanent preservation.\nTo fulfill its mission
  completely, the Commission must look for the voluntary assistance of public spirited
  citizens in every\ncommunity throughout the state. The general plan is to appoint
  a local representative, or COUNTY CHAIRMAN, in every\ncounty, who will organize
  and direct the\nwork of collecting that county''s war records.\nIn most cases the
  County Chairman will\nneed the help of other local people whom he\nwill associate
  with him as a COUNTY WAR\nRECORDS COMMITTEE, and as local representatives or committees
  in the outlying\ntowns and districts of the county according\nto the particular
  circumstances.

  to the Commission, though\ncounty committees are urged to provide\nsimilar records
  for the county collections.\nThere will also be built up a STATE WAR\nCOLLECTION
  composed in general of records relating to the war activities of the\nstate as a
  whole. This collection will include records emanating from the state\nheadquarters
  of the various agencies and\ninterests in the state, together with representative
  material relating to war activities\nand conditions in the several communities\nof
  the state. County committees are therefore asked to forward to the Commission\nall
  material secured by them which is of\nmore than local significance, or which for\nany
  other reason should be filed in the main\ncollection. The local committees are also\nurged
  to send to the Commission such duplicate local  material as  may be gathered\n17\n","transl":{},"fullrs":"Volume21/mhs64813.tif","find":"3288.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2015-08-21","dmmodified":"2015-08-21","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"3203","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"1344536","cdmfilesizeformatted":"1.28
