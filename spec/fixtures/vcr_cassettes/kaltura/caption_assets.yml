        00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,110
        Okay.

        2
        00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,430
        Right.

        3
        00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,885
        You want to go to copycat?

        4
        00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:23,630
        I'd love to, but I have
        to finish my Avenue.

        5
        00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,910
        How did I said out loud

        6
        00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,250
        to myself as I do my
        older sister here

        7
        00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,250
        book who wonder how

        8
        00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,560
        Mrs. Michelson were like,
        that is enough money.

        9
        00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,090
        During my 14 years.

        10
        00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,819
        They had observed my sister
        at each different aged

        11
        00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,530
        >> and then tried to
        act that out when I

        12
        00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,570
        reach the new age each year.

        13
        00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,320
        But now what was I
        going to do with God?

        14
        00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,700
        Not just standard chips you eat.

        15
        00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,320
        Returned from in a few weeks,

        16
        00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,230
        she had been killed in
        an automobile accident,

        17
        00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,434
        and that meant that
        everything stopped

        18
        00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:56,120
        right there her last year.

        19
        00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,230
        But there will never be
        anymore yearbook or scrap,

        20
        00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,535
        but there will be no wedding
        pictures or anything.

        21
        00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,830
        How would I ever be 18,

        22
        00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,645
        a teenager in crucial,
        fast-changing years,

        23
        00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:17,360
        ready to become an adult to face

        24
        00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,120
        life's domain, its competition,

        25
        00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,230
        dreams, and her life
        model was gone.

        26
        00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,470
        Yet Darwin discovered
        that God, through Bethel,

        27
        00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,570
        would move new
        people in and out of

        28
        00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,320
        her life and all would
        leave and enduring mark.

        29
        00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,325
        But first, she found extremely
        good models at home.

        30
        00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,590
        My family history
        started at Bethel when

        31
        00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,870
        my parents mom attended

        32
        00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,160
        the College for two years

        33
        00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,855
        and that graduated
        from the college.

        34
        00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:47,570
        Anthony as a pastor,

        35
        00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,650
        he was always busy than in
        many evenings at church,

        36
        00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,440
        but he kept up with
        what we are doing here,

        37
        00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,920
        is never out of touch with
        this kid and keeping up with

        38
        00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,810
        the demands of his
        ministry is something

        39
        00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,434
        else that Doug
        bolts is noted for.

        40
        00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,790
        >> After graduation, Doug started

        41
        00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,790
        a church and ask go
        to Michigan pastor.

        42
        00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,244
        It's followed in Lansing,

        43
        00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:11,060
        Cedar Rapids, White Bear light,

        44
        00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,855
        you can declare now he's
        church planting Again.

        45
        00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,140
        As head of the Iowa
        Conference delegates,

        46
        00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,175
        one of those solid,

        47
        00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,275
        energetic seminary graduates,

        48
        00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,840
        more than 1100 of them
        through the years,

        49
        00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,380
        who represent why
        Bethel seminary exists.

        50
        00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,245
        Men and women who know God's Word

        51
        00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,455
        and live their faith in
        real life situations,

        52
        00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,840
        who see the whole world and are

        53
        00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,880
        challenged to be
        servants and helpers.

        54
        00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,590
        Other models began jumping out on

        55
        00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,080
        place. As Darwin started
        her college career,

        56
        00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
        he wasn't consciously
        aware of how much

        57
        00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,310
        the students and professors at

        58
        00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,230
        Bethel would help shape our life.

        59
        00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,350
        Models of enthusiasm,
        discipline of reaching out,

        60
        00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,750
        of not giving that

        61
        00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,290
        are in competition and
        training it backwards.

        62
        00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,145
        As athletic director,
        George Henry, in football,

        63
        00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,480
        as in all of athletics,

        64
        00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,689
        what we're supposed to be
        about is winning and losing.

        65
        00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,050
        >> Winning is important
        to us and winning is fun.

        66
        00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,990
        And yet at baffle, we want
        to take it one step further.

        67
        00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,455
        What we want for our
        athletes is to grow as

        68
        00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,870
        spiritual and social beings

        69
        00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,595
        through the medium of athletics.

        70
        00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,920
        And thus we use athletics

        71
        00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,140
        at a vehicle in which to promote

        72
        00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
        this growth came that ethics is

        73
        00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,040
        a very important part of
        my life and pretty map.

        74
        00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,170
        We just, unquote,
        Islamic Christian came.

        75
        00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,295
        I really began to realize
        what a proper attitude when

        76
        00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:01,640
        Aboriginal man Matthew security

        77
        00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,730
        breaches that was desirable
        since the CQI birth,

        78
        00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,610
        the Kingdom of God and
        thread and all these things.

        79
        00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,740
        >> Modelling also comes through

        80
        00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,770
        strenuous rehearsals
        and glorious results,

        81
        00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,260
        whether at a home cancer in

        82
        00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,290
        orchestra hall or
        a European tour.

        83
        00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,570
        Models of creative expression,

        84
        00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,230
        of finding solutions
        through mastery of

        85
        00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,170
        complex machine and models

        86
        00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,790
        and the movements and attitudes

        87
        00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,380
        of over 2 thousand students

        88
        00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,315
        from all over the United States,

        89
        00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:57,125
        from mission fields in
        many countries abroad,

        90
        00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,170
        plus the patterns of learning and

        91
        00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,320
        experience demonstrated
        by Christian scholars.

        92
        00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,500
        The skilled men and women
        of the Bethel faculty,

        93
        00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,590
        highly competent in
        their academic field,

        94
        00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,410
        guided by the instruction
        of God's infallible,

        95
        00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,660
        we're committed to helping

        96
        00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,105
        their students to
        be old person's,

        97
        00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:19,580
        helping them to think and mature.

        98
        00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,320
        When I came to
        battle, I didn't have

        99
        00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,360
        any specific vocational goal.

        100
        00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,780
        It was scary enough to starting
        college and all I wanted

        101
        00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,395
        was a place where I could
        grow maybe for a year or two.

        102
        00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,619
        But before length and pretty
        specific direction began.

        103
        00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,930
        >> From the faculty. It started

        104
        00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,310
        with the basic communication,

        105
        00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,530
        quite a good combination of

        106
        00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,455
        students and stimulation
        from the professor.

        107
        00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,285
        As we talked about my interests,

        108
        00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,800
        he encouraged me to major in

        109
        00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,590
        communication and combine
        the Program in Writing.

        110
        00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,860
        Referred by contrast, Jeff
        Magnusson had clear cut

        111
        00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,280
        idea about who vocational
        future and found at

        112
        00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,270
        Bethel the write to them
        count reaches objected.

        113
        00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,190
        Four years ago, I came to about

        114
        00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,900
        a specific idea of entering

        115
        00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,030
        their pre-medical
        program and having

        116
        00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,590
        achieved my goal this last

        117
        00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,630
        fall and come to
        the conclusion that

        118
        00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,490
        bevels chemistry
        department provides

        119
        00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,740
        some of the best
        pre-medical nation.

        120
        00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,290
        You see all kinds of

        121
        00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,600
        positive interaction
        between students and

        122
        00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,210
        professors after class lecture

        123
        00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,030
        and frequent encounters
        along the battle con,

        124
        00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,880
        course in quiet conversations,

        125
        00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,305
        in times of prayer.

        126
        00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,020
        Part of the direction I
        received at Bethel came through

        127
        00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,960
        tough and even
        negative situation.

        128
        00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,530
        Sir, I wanted to be
        challenged academically.

        129
        00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,900
        That's one of the
        reasons I chose befor,

        130
        00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,650
        But I never dreamed how much
        my mind would be stretched.

        131
        00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,535
        Papers correction
        all the way through.

        132
        00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,200
        It's amazing how myth with

        133
        00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,105
        Michael thing can tell
        you what's wrong.

        134
        00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,190
        Challenge you to do better and

        135
        00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,765
        make you feel good
        about yourself too.

        136
        00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:59,950
        Think about the
        rough time ahead of

        137
        00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,625
        the freshmen in an organizational
        communication path.

        138
        00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,085
        I never worked so hard for

        139
        00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,000
        my light biotic string
        to the booth, to myself.

        140
        00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,610
        Confident, you know
        you're worth something.

        141
        00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,330
        When a professor cares enough
        about to demand the best

        142
        00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:23,665
        you can get into that.

        143
        00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:27,325
        Graduate studies require
        even greater discipline

        144
        00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,550
        and theological education
        is no exception.

        145
        00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,700
        Mirrored, Erickson is a
        professor in the seminary.

        146
        00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,220
        We're preparing people here
        who are going to be students

        147
        00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,990
        all their lives and who in

        148
        00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,679
        effect are going to add
        examinations every week.

        149
        00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,430
        >> Our Lord taught that the
        reward for working well

        150
        00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,610
        done and even greater
        responsibility to serve.

        151
        00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,690
        And as someone who says,

        152
        00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,965
        what have I done well,

        153
        00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,230
        what can I do even
        better so that I can

        154
        00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,570
        improve and grow in
        my usefulness to

        155
        00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,710
        the Lord and serve and

        156
        00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,805
        love the privilege of
        being a useful servant.

        157
        00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,620
        It comes from a deeper

        158
        00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,215
        personal understanding
        of God's Word.

        159
        00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,420
        The unchanging foundation of

        160

        learning at baffled the Bible,

        161
        00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,600
        the underlying
        textbook in every lab.

        164
        00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,080
        >> It's true through our goal as

        165
        00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,550
        a department of biblical
        and theological studies is

        166
        00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,480
        primarily to equip
        men and women with

        167
        00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,505
        the skills and tools

        168
        00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,640
        to be lifelong
        students of the Bible.

        169
        00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,360
        That just a devotional
        study of the Bible,

        170
        00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,285
        as important
        certainly as that is.

        171
        00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,944
        But bible study as a discipline,

        172
        00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:53,885
        academic rigorous study,

        173
        00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,975
        Scripture to the end that

        174
        00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,634
        these men and women find
        more fully know God's Word

        175
        00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,155
        >> The very beginning seminary

        176
        00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,660
        had been based on
        biblical studies.

        177
        00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,310
        All through the years,

        178
        00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,200
        we have been deeply
        concerned and a

        179
        00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,900
        strong emphasis in Bible study,

        180
        00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
        whether we teach courses
        like Christian education,

        181
        00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,915
        counseling, preaching,
        or social ethics.

        182
        00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:20,405
        The emphasis is on the bible.

        183
        00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,750
        Our model, the servant of God,

        184
        00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,190
        communicating the Word of God,

        185
        00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,270
        gives expression to it.

        186
        00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,925
        Because of our concern
        for the Bible.

        187
        00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:31,460
        When we began the work of battles

        188
        00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,830

        00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,325
        we continue that all
        over the campus.

        190
        00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,660
        That wisdom, which comes

        191
        00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,730
        only through God's inspired Word,

        192
        00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,874
        is nurtured in daily chapel,

        194
        00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,115
        and in one-on-one encounters

        195
        00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,280
        as the Bible and its
        teachings penetrate

        196
        00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,130
        every aspect of life
        at Bethel so much

        00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,180
        the full scope of life be
        part of the learning process?

        198
        00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,490
        How vital are the liberal arts

        199
        00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,055
        in this attention to
        the whole person?

        200
        00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,380
        A college degree can mean much

        201
        00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,410
        more than a better job
        and a higher salary.

        202
        00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,990
        A broad liberal arts education

        203
        00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,110
        helps provide for
        Creative Living.

        204
        00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,880
        Nerd had to be much
        more than the data.

        205
        00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,670
        We provide a broad
        background in November,

        206
        00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,129
        like well, I'd been

        207
        00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,590
        >> john graduated, repaired,

        208
        00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,560
        compassionate and caring
        and not just business

        209
        00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,675
        graduates with
        technical competent

        210
        00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,390
        looking to climb the
        corporate ladder,

        211
        00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,750
        but men and women with
        moral and spiritual fiber

        212
        00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,355
        able to articulate

        213
        00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,990
        a Christian perspective on

        214
        00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,635
        the complex issues in business,
        industry, and government.

        215
        00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,830
        And able to represent
        Christ in workplace.

        216
        00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,310
        Occasionally, those of us in
        seminary administration or

        217
        00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,640
        at what kind of background
        is best for ministry.

        218
        00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,520
        And of course, God leads
        individuals from every walk

        219
        00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,655
        of life and educational
        field into the seminary.

        220
        00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,819
        But because the needs and
        opportunities of ministry

        221
        00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:09,980
        >> so diverse. For example,

        222
        00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,310
        our seminary catalog speaks
        of providing a program

        223
        00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,765
        relevant to the context of
        contemporary church life.

        224
        00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,490
        That's why we
        encourage students to

        225
        00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,860
        be broadly educated
        and impossible

        226
        00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,740
        to delve into the
        humanities to gain

        227
        00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,545
        historical perspective and to

        228
        00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:31,190
        learn to handle language
        with every skill possible.

        229
        00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,030
        In other words, to be
        liberally educated.

        230
        00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,985
        As I think about
        my college years,

        231
        00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,740
        sometimes frightening as well

        232
        00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,580
        as I'm amazed that
        of the cabinet.

        233
        00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,925
        And certainly when I
        ended that Merkel intern

        234
        00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:50,150
        governors after filling part
        of the requirements for

        235
        00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,125
        my major oven helped
        me gain confidence.

        236
        00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,590
        And I found the more I gained
        and pamphlet The left.

        237
        00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,835
        I thought about myself

        238
        00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:01,145
        and became more
        concerned about others.

        239
        00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,920
        I learned that people
        are more important

        240
        00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,590
        than how I might do
        on a particular exam.

        241
        00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,200
        And I never did any work
        done, according Jeff,

        242
        00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,220
        because they tried to be
        a fat people caring about

        243
        00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,635
        people that are calling as

        244
        00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:19,910
        Christian surprise gift
        of a motorized chair.

        245
        00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,920
        So they do solace and could be

        246
        00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,470
        more independent. Welcome Week.

        247
        00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,630
        Volunteers buzzing around looking

        248
        00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,434
        for ways to be helpful. Residue

        249
        00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,270
        >> Open to students
        on their floor.

        250
        00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,260
        Blood donor, a fleet of
        students spending their summer,

        251
        00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,000
        needy areas of the world.

        252
        00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,550
        Inspiring for me to
        realize that while

        253
        00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,949
        our students are in
        training for ministry,

        254
        00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,130
        God chooses to use them
        in significant ways.

        255
        00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,710
        I think of George Syndrome
        came to be known as

        256
        00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,905
        Chicken George because
        while he was in Thailand,

        257
        00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,230
        he invented a portable
        Chicken group

        258
        00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,460
        that will allow the people

        259
        00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,150
        there to have Egg Producers
        and then eat the chickens.

        260
        00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,200
        To or think of triste Holland
        and Paul de Bernanke,

        261
        00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,310
        who climbed 20 thousand
        foot tall Mount McKinley

        262
        00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,930
        for a reason and much greater

        263
        00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,194
        than simply getting to the top.

        264
        00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,400
        >> There's nothing that
        my climbing partner isn't

        265
        00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,260
        I enjoy more than the prospect of

        266
        00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,910
        spending a month on a big Alaskan

        267
        00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,190
        mountain or with Mount McKinley,

        268
        00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,220
        It had to be more than just
        a client for fun and sport.

        269
        00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,920
        When we thought that it was
        possible to raise money to

        270
        00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,365
        help Cambodian refugees
        through world vision.

        271
        00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,920
        Because of our climb, it
        all became very worthwhile.

        272
        00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,684
        Purpose of bathroom is
        mapped to produce completion

        273
        00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,740
        >> intellectual customers.

        274
        00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,165
        Rather, it's to make our
        college and seminary graduates

        275
        00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:43,760
        uncomfortable enough to do

        276
        00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,550
        something about the prism
        shape of the world.

        277
        00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,470
        And we do all kinds
        of things to try and

        278
        00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,675
        get people to do what they
        don't really want to do.

        279
        00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:53,225
        But in the end, the
        motivating factor

        280
        00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,460
        is to understand
        the grace of God,

        281
        00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,570
        to have a responsive
        gratitude and to

        282
        00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,250
        demonstrate this gratitude by

        283
        00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,570
        doing what he wants us to do.

        284
        00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:29,930
        >> Being around anymore.
        I hear a lot about labor.

        285
        00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:39,860
        They were you worried
        about Latin for,

        286
        00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,975
        I know the play and have for

        287
        00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,840
        the Lord to give you a future.

        288
        00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,860
        Mm-hm.
