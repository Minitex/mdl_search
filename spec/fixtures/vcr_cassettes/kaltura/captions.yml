        00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,110
        Okay.

        2
        00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,430
        Right.

        3
        00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,885
        You want to go to copycat?

        4
        00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:23,630
        I'd love to, but I have
        to finish my Avenue.

        5
        00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,910
        How did I said out loud

        6
        00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,250
        to myself as I do my
        older sister here

        7
        00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,250
        book who wonder how

        8
        00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,560
        Mrs. Michelson were like,
        that is enough money.

        9
        00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,090
        During my 14 years.

        10
        00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,819
        They had observed my sister
        at each different aged

        11
        00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,530
        >> and then tried to
        act that out when I

        12
        00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,570
        reach the new age each year.

        13
        00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,320
        But now what was I
        going to do with God?

        14
        00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,700
        Not just standard chips you eat.

        15
        00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,320
        Returned from in a few weeks,

        16
        00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,230
        she had been killed in
        an automobile accident,

        17
        00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,434
        and that meant that
        everything stopped

        18
        00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:56,120
        right there her last year.

        19
        00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,230
        But there will never be
        anymore yearbook or scrap,

        20
        00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,535
        but there will be no wedding
        pictures or anything.

        21
        00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,830
        How would I ever be 18,

        22
        00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,645
        a teenager in crucial,
        fast-changing years,

        23
        00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:17,360
        ready to become an adult to face

        24
        00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,120
        life's domain, its competition,

        25
        00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,230
        dreams, and her life
        model was gone.

        26
        00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,470
        Yet Darwin discovered
        that God, through Bethel,

        27
        00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,570
        would move new
        people in and out of

        28
        00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,320
        her life and all would
        leave and enduring mark.

        29
        00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,325
        But first, she found extremely
        good models at home.

        30
        00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,590
        My family history
        started at Bethel when

        31
        00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,870
        my parents mom attended

        32
        00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,160
        the College for two years

        33
        00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,855
        and that graduated
        from the college.

        34
        00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:47,570
        Anthony as a pastor,

        35
        00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,650
        he was always busy than in
        many evenings at church,

        36
        00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,440
        but he kept up with
        what we are doing here,

        37
        00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,920
        is never out of touch with
        this kid and keeping up with

        38
        00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,810
        the demands of his
        ministry is something

        39
        00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,434
        else that Doug
        bolts is noted for.

        40
        00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,790
        >> After graduation, Doug started

        41
        00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,790
        a church and ask go
        to Michigan pastor.

        42
        00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,244
        It's followed in Lansing,

        43
        00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:11,060
        Cedar Rapids, White Bear light,

        44
        00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,855
        you can declare now he's
        church planting Again.

        45
        00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,140
        As head of the Iowa
        Conference delegates,

        46
        00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,175
        one of those solid,

        47
        00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,275
        energetic seminary graduates,

        48
        00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,840
        more than 1100 of them
        through the years,

        49
        00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,380
        who represent why
        Bethel seminary exists.

        50
        00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,245
        Men and women who know God's Word

        51
        00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,455
        and live their faith in
        real life situations,

        52
        00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,840
        who see the whole world and are

        53
        00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,880
        challenged to be
        servants and helpers.

        54
        00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,590
        Other models began jumping out on

        55
        00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,080
        place. As Darwin started
        her college career,

        56
        00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
        he wasn't consciously
        aware of how much

        57
        00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,310
        the students and professors at

        58
        00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,230
        Bethel would help shape our life.

        59
        00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,350
        Models of enthusiasm,
        discipline of reaching out,

        60
        00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,750
        of not giving that

        61
        00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,290
        are in competition and
        training it backwards.

        62
        00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,145
        As athletic director,
        George Henry, in football,

        63
        00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,480
        as in all of athletics,

        64
        00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,689
        what we're supposed to be
        about is winning and losing.

        65
        00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,050
        >> Winning is important
        to us and winning is fun.

        66
        00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,990
        And yet at baffle, we want
        to take it one step further.

        67
        00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,455
        What we want for our
        athletes is to grow as

        68
        00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,870
        spiritual and social beings

        69
        00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,595
        through the medium of athletics.

        70
        00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,920
        And thus we use athletics

        71
        00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,140
        at a vehicle in which to promote

        72
        00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
        this growth came that ethics is

        73
        00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,040
        a very important part of
        my life and pretty map.

        74
        00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,170
        We just, unquote,
        Islamic Christian came.

        75
        00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,295
        I really began to realize
        what a proper attitude when

        76
        00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:01,640
        Aboriginal man Matthew security

        77
        00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,730
        breaches that was desirable
        since the CQI birth,

        78
        00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,610
        the Kingdom of God and
        thread and all these things.

        79
        00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,740
        >> Modelling also comes through

        80
        00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,770
        strenuous rehearsals
        and glorious results,

        81
        00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,260
        whether at a home cancer in

        82
        00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,290
        orchestra hall or
        a European tour.

        83
        00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,570
        Models of creative expression,

        84
        00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,230
        of finding solutions
        through mastery of

        85
        00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,170
        complex machine and models

        86
        00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,790
        and the movements and attitudes

        87
        00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,380
        of over 2 thousand students

        88
        00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,315
        from all over the United States,

        89
        00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:57,125
        from mission fields in
        many countries abroad,

        90
        00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,170
        plus the patterns of learning and

        91
        00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,320
        experience demonstrated
        by Christian scholars.

        92
        00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,500
        The skilled men and women
        of the Bethel faculty,

        93
        00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,590
        highly competent in
        their academic field,

        94
        00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,410
        guided by the instruction
        of God's infallible,

        95
        00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,660
        we're committed to helping

        96
        00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,105
        their students to
        be old person's,

        97
        00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:19,580
        helping them to think and mature.

        98
        00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,320
        When I came to
        battle, I didn't have

        99
        00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,360
        any specific vocational goal.

        100
        00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,780
        It was scary enough to starting
        college and all I wanted

        101
        00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,395
        was a place where I could
        grow maybe for a year or two.

        102
        00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,619
        But before length and pretty
        specific direction began.

        103
        00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,930
        >> From the faculty. It started

        104
        00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,310
        with the basic communication,

        105
        00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,530
        quite a good combination of

        106
        00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,455
        students and stimulation
        from the professor.

        107
        00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,285
        As we talked about my interests,

        108
        00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,800
        he encouraged me to major in

        109
        00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,590
        communication and combine
        the Program in Writing.

        110
        00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,860
        Referred by contrast, Jeff
        Magnusson had clear cut

        111
        00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,280
        idea about who vocational
        future and found at

        112
        00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,270
        Bethel the write to them
        count reaches objected.

        113
        00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,190
        Four years ago, I came to about

        114
        00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,900
        a specific idea of entering

        115
        00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,030
        their pre-medical
        program and having

        116
        00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,590
        achieved my goal this last

        117
        00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,630
        fall and come to
        the conclusion that

        118
        00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,490
        bevels chemistry
        department provides

        119
        00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,740
        some of the best
        pre-medical nation.

        120
        00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,290
        You see all kinds of

        121
        00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,600
        positive interaction
        between students and

        122
        00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,210
        professors after class lecture

        123
        00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,030
        and frequent encounters
        along the battle con,

        124
        00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,880
        course in quiet conversations,

        125
        00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,305
        in times of prayer.

        126
        00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,020
        Part of the direction I
        received at Bethel came through

        127
        00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,960
        tough and even
        negative situation.

        128
        00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,530
        Sir, I wanted to be
        challenged academically.

        129
        00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,900
        That's one of the
        reasons I chose befor,

        130
        00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,650
        But I never dreamed how much
        my mind would be stretched.

        131
        00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,535
        Papers correction
        all the way through.

        132
        00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,200
        It's amazing how myth with

        133
        00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,105
        Michael thing can tell
        you what's wrong.

        134
        00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,190
        Challenge you to do better and

        135
        00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,765
        make you feel good
        about yourself too.

        136
        00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:59,950
        Think about the
        rough time ahead of

        137
        00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,625
        the freshmen in an organizational
        communication path.

        138
        00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,085
        I never worked so hard for

        139
        00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,000
        my light biotic string
        to the booth, to myself.

        140
        00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,610
        Confident, you know
        you're worth something.

        141
        00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,330
        When a professor cares enough
        about to demand the best

        142
        00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:23,665
        you can get into that.

        143
        00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:27,325
        Graduate studies require
        even greater discipline

        144
        00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,550
        and theological education
        is no exception.

        145
        00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,700
        Mirrored, Erickson is a
        professor in the seminary.

        146
        00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,220
        We're preparing people here
        who are going to be students

        147
        00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,990
        all their lives and who in

        148
        00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,679
        effect are going to add
        examinations every week.

        149
        00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,430
        >> Our Lord taught that the
        reward for working well

        150
        00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,610
        done and even greater
        responsibility to serve.

        151
        00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,690
        And as someone who says,

        152
        00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,965
        what have I done well,

        153
        00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,230
        what can I do even
        better so that I can

        154
        00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,570
        improve and grow in
        my usefulness to

        155
        00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,710
        the Lord and serve and

        156
        00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,805
        love the privilege of
        being a useful servant.

        157
        00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,620
        It comes from a deeper

        158
        00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,215
        personal understanding
        of God's Word.

        159
        00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,420
        The unchanging foundation of

        160

        learning at baffled the Bible,

        161
        00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,600
        the underlying
        textbook in every lab.

        164
        00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,080
        >> It's true through our goal as

        165
        00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,550
        a department of biblical
        and theological studies is

        166
        00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,480
        primarily to equip
        men and women with

        167
        00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,505
        the skills and tools

        168
        00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,640
        to be lifelong
        students of the Bible.

        169
        00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,360
        That just a devotional
        study of the Bible,

        170
        00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,285
        as important
        certainly as that is.

        171
        00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,944
        But bible study as a discipline,

        172
        00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:53,885
        academic rigorous study,

        173
        00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,975
        Scripture to the end that

        174
        00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,634
        these men and women find
        more fully know God's Word

        175
        00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,155
        >> The very beginning seminary

        176
        00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,660
        had been based on
        biblical studies.

        177
        00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,310
        All through the years,

        178
        00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,200
        we have been deeply
        concerned and a

        179
        00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,900
        strong emphasis in Bible study,

        180
        00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
        whether we teach courses
        like Christian education,

        181
        00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,915
        counseling, preaching,
        or social ethics.

        182
        00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:20,405
        The emphasis is on the bible.

        183
        00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,750
        Our model, the servant of God,

        184
        00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,190
        communicating the Word of God,

        185
        00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,270
        gives expression to it.

        186
        00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,925
        Because of our concern
        for the Bible.

        187
        00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:31,460
        When we began the work of battles

        00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,325

        over the campus.

        190
        00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,660
        That wisdom, which comes

        191
        00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,730
        only through God's inspired Word,

        00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,874
        is nurtured in daily chapel,

        195
        00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,280
        as the Bible and its
        teachings penetrate

        part of the learning process?

        198
        00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,490
        How vital are the liberal arts

        199
        00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,055
        in this attention to
        the whole person?

        200
        00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,380
        A college degree can mean much

        201
        00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,410
        more than a better job
        and a higher salary.

        202
        00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,990
        A broad liberal arts education

        203
        00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,110
        helps provide for
        Creative Living.

        204
        00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,880
        Nerd had to be much
        more than the data.

        205
        00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,670
        We provide a broad
        background in November,

        206
        00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,129
        like well, I'd been

        207
        00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,590
        >> john graduated, repaired,

        208
        00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,560
        compassionate and caring
        and not just business

        209
        00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,675
        graduates with
        technical competent

        210
        00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,390
        looking to climb the
        corporate ladder,

        211
        00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,750
        but men and women with
        moral and spiritual fiber

        212
        00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,355
        able to articulate

        213
        00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,990
        a Christian perspective on

        214
        00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,635
        the complex issues in business,
        industry, and government.

        215
        00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,830
        And able to represent
        Christ in workplace.

        216
        00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,310
        Occasionally, those of us in
        seminary administration or

        217
        00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,640
        at what kind of background
        is best for ministry.

        218
        00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,520
        And of course, God leads
        individuals from every walk

        219
        00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,655
        of life and educational
        field into the seminary.

        220
        00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,819
        But because the needs and
        opportunities of ministry

        221
        00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:09,980
        >> so diverse. For example,

        222
        00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,310
        our seminary catalog speaks
        of providing a program

        223
        00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,765
        relevant to the context of
        contemporary church life.

        224
        00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,490
        That's why we
        encourage students to

        225
        00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,860
        be broadly educated
        and impossible

        226
        00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,740
        to delve into the
        humanities to gain

        227
        00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,545
        historical perspective and to

        228
        00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:31,190
        learn to handle language
        with every skill possible.

        229
        00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,030
        In other words, to be
        liberally educated.

        230
        00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,985
        As I think about
        my college years,

        231
        00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,740
        sometimes frightening as well

        232
        00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,580
        as I'm amazed that
        of the cabinet.

        233
        00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,925
        And certainly when I
        ended that Merkel intern

        234
        00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:50,150
        governors after filling part
        of the requirements for

        235
        00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,125
        my major oven helped
        me gain confidence.

        236
        00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,590
        And I found the more I gained
        and pamphlet The left.

        237
        00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,835
        I thought about myself

        238
        00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:01,145
        and became more
        concerned about others.

        239
        00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,920
        I learned that people
        are more important

        240
        00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,590
        than how I might do
        on a particular exam.

        241
        00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,200
        And I never did any work
        done, according Jeff,

        242
        00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,220
        because they tried to be
        a fat people caring about

        243
        00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,635
        people that are calling as

        244
        00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:19,910
        Christian surprise gift
        of a motorized chair.

        245
        00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,920
        So they do solace and could be

        246
        00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,470
        more independent. Welcome Week.

        247
        00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,630
        Volunteers buzzing around looking

        248
        00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,434
        for ways to be helpful. Residue

        249
        00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,270
        >> Open to students
        on their floor.

        250
        00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,260
        Blood donor, a fleet of
        students spending their summer,

        251
        00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,000
        needy areas of the world.

        252
        00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,550
        Inspiring for me to
        realize that while

        253
        00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,949
        our students are in
        training for ministry,

        254
        00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,130
        God chooses to use them
        in significant ways.

        255
        00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,710
        I think of George Syndrome
        came to be known as

        256
        00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,905
        Chicken George because
        while he was in Thailand,

        257
        00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,230
        he invented a portable
        Chicken group

        258
        00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,460
        that will allow the people

        259
        00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,150
        there to have Egg Producers
        and then eat the chickens.

        260
        00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,200
        To or think of triste Holland
        and Paul de Bernanke,

        261
        00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,310
        who climbed 20 thousand
        foot tall Mount McKinley

        262
        00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,930
        for a reason and much greater

        263
        00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,194
        than simply getting to the top.

        264
        00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,400
        >> There's nothing that
        my climbing partner isn't

        265
        00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,260
        I enjoy more than the prospect of

        266
        00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,910
        spending a month on a big Alaskan

        267
        00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,190
        mountain or with Mount McKinley,

        268
        00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,220
        It had to be more than just
        a client for fun and sport.

        269
        00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,920
        When we thought that it was
        possible to raise money to

        270
        00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,365
        help Cambodian refugees
        through world vision.

        271
        00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,920
        Because of our climb, it
        all became very worthwhile.

        272
        00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,684
        Purpose of bathroom is
        mapped to produce completion

        273
        00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,740
        >> intellectual customers.

        274
        00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,165
        Rather, it's to make our
        college and seminary graduates

        275
        00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:43,760
        uncomfortable enough to do

        276
        00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,550
        something about the prism
        shape of the world.

        277
        00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,470
        And we do all kinds
        of things to try and

        278
        00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,675
        get people to do what they
        don't really want to do.

        279
        00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:53,225
        But in the end, the
        motivating factor

        280
        00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,460
        is to understand
        the grace of God,

        281
        00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,570
        to have a responsive
        gratitude and to

        282
        00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,250
        demonstrate this gratitude by

        283
        00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,570
        doing what he wants us to do.

        284
        00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:29,930
        >> Being around anymore.
        I hear a lot about labor.

        285
        00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:39,860
        They were you worried
        about Latin for,

        286
        00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,975
        I know the play and have for

        287
        00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,840
        the Lord to give you a future.

        288
        00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,860
        Mm-hm.

        That'll college
        and seminary today

        2
        00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,470
        come with me through
        these gates to

        3
        00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,780
        a beautiful all new canvas,

        4
        00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,760
        indeed a proper setting for

        5
        00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,080
        the Christian liberal arts

        6
        00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,090
        and conservative
        theological education.

        7
        00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,145
        Looking at our campus
        from the Southeast,

        8
        00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:30,460
        we see the college and seminary
        located in the beautiful,

        9
        00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,340
        rolling wooded hills
        beside lake Valentine.

        10
        00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,750
        This is just five miles
        north of our old campus.

        11
        00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,015
        Here the emphasis is on
        the seminary complex

        12
        00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:46,320
        campus, as it appears
        from the west.

        13
        00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,740
        This area will someday be

        14
        00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,200
        occupied by the
        administration building.

        15
        00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,280
        Bethel probably boasts one of

        16
        00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,270
        the most beautiful campus
        settings in the country.

        17
        00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,000
        Each of the college
        buildings is connected with

        18
        00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,805
        the other building by a
        weatherproof walkway,

        19
        00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:06,875
        both above and below ground.

        20
        00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,840
        Hi, I'm sure you will
        agree if you walk

        21
        00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,060
        between the buildings
        on the Old Campus,

        22
        00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,210
        this indeed is a worthy edition.

        23
        00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,400
        We look at the campus now from

        24
        00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,105
        the east with the new
        townhouses and view.

        25
        00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:22,550
        This is the field of conflict for

        26
        00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,190
        football, baseball, and soccer

        27
        00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,595
        athletics out
        important at Bethel.

        28
        00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:31,100
        Our new dorms consist of

        29
        00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,725
        14 units and two
        clusters of seven.

        30
        00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:37,580
        We can house 2221 unit 234,

        31
        00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,210
        and the other a total of 456.

        32
        00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,760
        And they are all filled with

        33
        00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,940
        the housing on the Old
        Campus filled as well.

        34
        00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,570
        Each apartment
        contains six students.

        35
        00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,960
        There is a health center and
        recreation room available in

        36
        00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,500
        this complex and all the
        other complexes as well.

        37
        00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,320
        The total enrollment in
        this year will run between

        38
        00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,575
        12851300 in the college in
        about 240 in the seminary.

        39
        00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:09,110
        This was the first dormitory to

        40
        00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,060
        have been constructed
        on the new campus.

        41
        00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,000
        It holds 120 students.

        42
        00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,430
        Here's located one of

        43
        00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,595
        the most up-to-date libraries
        in the state of Minnesota.

        44
        00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,980
        It is on two levels.

        45
        00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,260
        Individual study units provide

        46
        00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,790
        privacy for tape recording,

        47
        00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,320
        as well as other functions

        48
        00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,420
        which will be difficult
        to accomplish.

        49
        00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,489
        In the main library,

        50
        00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:34,070
        our students have access not only

        51
        00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,545
        to our 79 thousand volumes,

        52
        00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,780

        seven other colleges,

        53
        00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,194
        as well as the Hill library,

        54
        00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,520
        they can reach a total of

        55
        00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,130
        3 million volumes within
        two days of requests,

        The study a biological function

        97
        00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,825
        is a joy in this facility.

        00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,825
        And other areas include
        preparation for public education.

        100
        00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:03,725
        Here is one of our student
        teachers in action.

        101
        00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:06,710
        Well, time fails.

        102
        00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,020
        Meter mentioned is they
        deserve to be mentioned.

        103

        Biblical studies, foreign
        languages, history,

        104

        philosophy, psychology,

        105
        00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,590
        social studies, Speech and Drama.

        106
        00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,435
        There are many ways for
        self-expression battle.

        107
        00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,475
        If you are sports minded,

        108
        00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:31,310
        you can be an
        enthusiastic spectator

        109

        or a participant on
        intramural are varsity level.

        110
        00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,340
        Eight different sports are

        111
        00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,080
        conducted on the varsity level.

        112
        00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,890
        And Bethel is a member the
        tri-state athletic conference.

        113
        00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,675
        Perhaps your thing is
        basketball or track.

        114
        00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,790
        The grunt and grow an artist have

        115
        00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,770
        their share of the limelight.

        116
        00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,370
        Our football wires do and
        die for good. Old Bethel.

        117
        00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,680
        Bethel has had championship
        tennis squats.

        118
        00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,355
        Baseball brings honour
        to AJ alma mater.

        119
        00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,740
        Now soccer has been

        120
        00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,085
        successfully added to
        the velocity program.

        121
        00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:13,160
        Our lovely young
        ladies are in hand for

        122
        00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,930
        all major events to encourage

        123
        00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,790
        both participants and spectators.

        124
        00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,950
        A most important part
        of the Bethel story is

        125
        00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,480
        the contribution of the seminary

        126
        00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,295
        to the Baptist
        general conference,

        127
        00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,835
        as well as to all major
        evangelical groups.

        128
        00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,710
        Since its inception,

        129
        00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,840
        theological studies
        at Bethel seminary

        130
        00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,370
        had been set within the framework

        131
        00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,230
        of historic evangelical theology.

        132
        00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,010
        Particular emphasis has been

        133
        00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,020
        placed upon a
        theology which gives

        134
        00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,505
        primacy to the Bible as the
        source of Christian doctrine.

        135
        00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:51,890
        Major attention has been given to

        136
        00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,875
        the foundational truths
        of evangelical theology,

        137
        00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,515
        such as the reliability
        of the scriptures,

        138
        00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:59,195
        THE gravity of man,

        139
        00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,565
        the necessity of
        divine redemption,

        140
        00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,590
        personal regeneration,

        141
        00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,525
        the resurrection of believers,

        142
        00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,460
        and the imminent
        visible return of

        143
        00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,230
        Jesus Christ, our Lord.

        144
        00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,930
        And say, Dr. Gordon Johnson

        145
        00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,090
        announced this year
        that Bethel graduated

        146
        00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,910
        55 seniors and is currently

        147
        00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,990
        enrolling between

        148
        00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,240
        two hundred and forty and two
        hundred and fifty students.

        149
        00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,775
        Bethel is far more
        than its buildings.

        150
        00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:29,705
        Bethel is more than superior
        academic achievement.

        151
        00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:33,350
        Bethel is even bigger than
        the all important graduation

        152
        00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,950
        on Bethel is bigger than
        any personal achievement.

        153
        00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,930
        As important as it is,

        154
        00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,799
        Bethel is a corporate
        opportunity to grow with others

        155
        00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,080
        >> in spiritual
        outreach and develop.

        156
        00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,315
        Although chapel is not
        required at Bethel,

        157
        00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,030
        it is most significant
        that most of

        158
        00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,610
        the student body unites
        each day for worship.

        159
        00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,690
        Time to time, the
        entire student body,

        160
        00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,920
        both seminary in college,

        161
        00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,950
        meet outdoors in a great
        natural ampitheater.

        162
        00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,260
        Jerry Healy shares with
        us student testimonies.

        163
        00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,790
        Now from our campus

        164
        00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,010
        is a Christian

        165
        00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,815
        arts colleague, James
        Theological Seminary

        166
        00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:34,745
        dedicated to the development
        of a strong people,

        167
        00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:39,260
        fully matures, sensitive,
        and inner directed.

        168
        00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,885
        A people continually growing

        169
        00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,185
        toward the model of Jesus Christ.

        170
        00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:49,070
        I've only been at Beth
        and I think the thing

        171
        00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,610
        that impresses me the most
        was the Christian community.

        172
        00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,360
        Yes, I think it's so
        important to integrate

        173
        00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,290
        academic and special thanks

        174
        00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,255
        to the thing I most crazy about,

        175
        00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,520
        about FAFSA is that

        176
        00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,935
        it's been sorry about
        the whole person.

        177
        00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:14,195
        Academic or intellectual
        or spiritual Sosa.

        178
        00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,590
        But watching such that I can have

        179
        00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,165
        a relationship between faculty.

        180
        00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,495
        Ostinato festivals are really

        181
        00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,395
        sincere and they really
        want to be loved.

        182
        00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:27,785
        People town opening my mind

        183
        00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:31,940
        to expand on almost any
        broad thing that I want to.

        184
        00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,365
        Education I'm getting
        here is type.

        185
        00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,990
        And that I think has

        186
        00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,450
        prepared me for the
        direction I'm going.

        187
        00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,585
        I think it's given us a
        quality education advisor,

        188
        00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,280
        confidence learning,

        189
        00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,990
        part of that community
        experience I

        190
        00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,670
        see as it's trying to find

        191
        00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,500
        a way to relate
        what we're learning

        192
        00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,360
        in our classes to our
        Christian experience.

        193
        00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,265
        >> But what about Bethel?

        194
        00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,625
        In a day when colleges are
        closing all over the nation,

        195
        00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,820
        when enrollments are
        falling off at seminaries.

        196
        00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,640
        What about Bethel, Dr. Lundquist?

        197
        00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,800
        I have just begun my 20th year as

        198
        00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,320
        president of Bethel
        College in seminary.

        199
        00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,780
        And I want to say that
        from the perspective

        200
        00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,690
        of almost two decades
        in this office,

        201
        00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,790
        that the work of
        leading our college

        202
        00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,770
        and our Seminary
        has never been more

        203
        00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,335
        exciting or more satisfying

        204
        00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:30,635
        or more challenging
        than it is this year.

        205
        00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,300
        I'm so glad that when

        206
        00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,610
        the Lord called me
        into his service,

        207
        00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,690
        sign me to the task of
        working with young people.

        208
        00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,610
        And I have a sense of

        209
        00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,120
        great personal satisfaction
        in seeking to relate

        210
        00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,270
        my own life and
        commitment to Christ to

        211
        00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,010
        the hundreds of
        young people who are

        212
        00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,260
        on the campus year after year,

        213
        00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,130
        and pray that as they
        find their place in life,

        214
        00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,980
        God will use them to help shape

        215
        00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,775
        the future of our world
        with Christian values.

        216
        00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:04,550
        During the course of the
        two decades that I've

        217
        00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,160
        had the privilege of being
        on the Bethel campus,

        218
        00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,300
        I would guess that I have had
        the opportunity of working

        219
        00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,730
        directly or indirectly with

        220
        00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,970
        more than 15 thousand
        young people.

        221
        00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,325
        And wherever I go
        around the world,

        222
        00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,055
        I see them busy for Jesus Christ.

        223
        00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,950
        They are in almost every
        field of endeavor.

        224
        00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,884
        Some are college president's,

        225
        00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,360
        some are presence of
        Christian schools like

        226
        00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,895
        Bethel College and a seminary.

        227
        00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,475
        Some are teachers in
        public universities,

        228
        00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:38,105
        some are doctors and
        lawyers and businessmen.

        229
        00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,730
        Many are social workers and are

        230
        00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,300
        extending their lives into
        this field of human endeavor.

        231
        00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,970
        Many are missionaries
        and pastors on

        232
        00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,765
        the front line proclaiming
        the gospel of Jesus Christ.

        233
        00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,670
        I always come back from seeing

        234
        00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,320
        these alumni at work around

        235
        00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,430
        the world praising God all
        over again for the share that

        236
        00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,090
        Mrs. Lundquist and I
        have in their lives.

        237
        00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,850
        Just the other day, I
        received a note from

        238
        00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,445
        a young girl who
        graduated last spring.

        239
        00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,870
        He's now the director of

        240
        00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,480
        a Bible school program
        on the west coast.

        241
        00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,090
        She wrote saying that during
        the preceding summer,

        242
        00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,140
        she had the chance of

        243
        00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,910
        leading 71 children to

        244
        00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,265
        a saving knowledge
        of Jesus Christ.

        245
        00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,780
        So she was writing out a great
        enthusiasm along with it.

        246
        00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,910
        This young girl just
        a few months out of

        247
        00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,870
        Bethel and closed a
        money order for $40,

        248
        00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,130
        her first gift as an
        alumna to her alma mater.

        249
        00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,875
        With it, she said a little note,

        250
        00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,595
        you might be interested
        in one paragraph of it.

        251
        00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:42,395
        This young girl wrote,

        252
        00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,200
        I graduated from
        Bethel this past May,

        253
        00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,970
        and I never told you how much.

        254
        00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,710
        I appreciate both of you.

        255
        00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,050
        This is addressed to
        both Mrs. Lundquist,

        256
        00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,210
        myself, you were and

        257
        00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,565
        have continued to be
        an inspiration to me.

        258
        00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,320
        I pray that God will richly

        259
        00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,495
        bless you both for
        all you've done.

        260
        00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:00,935
        Not just for battle,

        261
        00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,965
        but for me and all the
        individual students.

        262
        00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,705
        We love you dearly.

        263
        00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:07,520
        And I want you to
        know that I will be

        264
        00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,040
        continually praying for you both.

        265
        00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,200
        Well, that's enough to keep

        266
        00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,510
        a president going for
        another whole year.

        267
        00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,600
        And it's only a small sample of

        268
        00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
        the enthusiasm of one
        alumnus that i c,

        269
        00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,480
        multiplied and many
        lives around the world,

        270
        00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,605
        and that I share myself long ago,

        271
        00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:30,560
        Mark Hopkins said that
        the ideal picture of

        272
        00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,370
        a school was made up of one
        student and one teacher,

        273
        00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,665
        each on two ends of a log.

        274
        00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,300
        And when they were there,

        275
        00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,120
        they had an educational
        experience going.

        276
        00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,400
        I think, however that
        we would have to

        277
        00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,500
        say that somewhere
        on that log there is

        278
        00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,755
        a third person and
        that's the partner

        279
        00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,535
        like you in the life
        of Bethel people.

        280
        00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,620
        And we believe in the
        mission of our school,

        281
        00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,720
        who believe in
        young people today,

        282
        00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,080
        who believe in the need for
        Christian higher education,

        283
        00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,060
        who believe in using education

        284
        00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,370
        as an instrument of the gospel.

        285
        00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,340
        And who, as a result
        of these beliefs,

        286
        00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,925
        are investing their
        gifts in battle.

        287
        00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:15,110
        I feel that you are partners
        with us in helping to shape

        288
        00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,930
        a whole new generation that can

        289
        00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,305
        make a difference for Jesus
        Christ in this world.

        290
        00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:23,840
        I hope that you will
        want to continue to

        291
        00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,225
        be a partner at the
        level of stewardship.

        292
        00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,410
        And that this year you
        will again find great joy

        293
        00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,804
        and satisfaction yourself
        in multiplying your life

        294
        00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:38,060
        >> into the lives of
        hundreds of young people

        295
        00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,260
        whose education you
        make possible at Beso.

        296
        00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,620
        Thank you so much for what
        you do and for what you are.

        297
        00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,570
        God bless you richly.
