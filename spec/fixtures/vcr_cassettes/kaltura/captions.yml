        00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,110
        Okay.

        2
        00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,430
        Right.

        3
        00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,885
        You want to go to copycat?

        4
        00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:23,630
        I'd love to, but I have
        to finish my Avenue.

        5
        00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,910
        How did I said out loud

        6
        00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,250
        to myself as I do my
        older sister here

        7
        00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,250
        book who wonder how

        8
        00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,560
        Mrs. Michelson were like,
        that is enough money.

        9
        00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,090
        During my 14 years.

        10
        00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,819
        They had observed my sister
        at each different aged

        11
        00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,530
        >> and then tried to
        act that out when I

        12
        00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,570
        reach the new age each year.

        13
        00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,320
        But now what was I
        going to do with God?

        14
        00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,700
        Not just standard chips you eat.

        15
        00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,320
        Returned from in a few weeks,

        16
        00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,230
        she had been killed in
        an automobile accident,

        17
        00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,434
        and that meant that
        everything stopped

        18
        00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:56,120
        right there her last year.

        19
        00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,230
        But there will never be
        anymore yearbook or scrap,

        20
        00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,535
        but there will be no wedding
        pictures or anything.

        21
        00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,830
        How would I ever be 18,

        22
        00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,645
        a teenager in crucial,
        fast-changing years,

        23
        00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:17,360
        ready to become an adult to face

        24
        00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,120
        life's domain, its competition,

        25
        00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,230
        dreams, and her life
        model was gone.

        26
        00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,470
        Yet Darwin discovered
        that God, through Bethel,

        27
        00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,570
        would move new
        people in and out of

        28
        00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,320
        her life and all would
        leave and enduring mark.

        29
        00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,325
        But first, she found extremely
        good models at home.

        30
        00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,590
        My family history
        started at Bethel when

        31
        00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,870
        my parents mom attended

        32
        00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,160
        the College for two years

        33
        00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,855
        and that graduated
        from the college.

        34
        00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:47,570
        Anthony as a pastor,

        35
        00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,650
        he was always busy than in
        many evenings at church,

        36
        00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,440
        but he kept up with
        what we are doing here,

        37
        00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,920
        is never out of touch with
        this kid and keeping up with

        38
        00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,810
        the demands of his
        ministry is something

        39
        00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,434
        else that Doug
        bolts is noted for.

        40
        00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,790
        >> After graduation, Doug started

        41
        00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,790
        a church and ask go
        to Michigan pastor.

        42
        00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,244
        It's followed in Lansing,

        43
        00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:11,060
        Cedar Rapids, White Bear light,

        44
        00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,855
        you can declare now he's
        church planting Again.

        45
        00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,140
        As head of the Iowa
        Conference delegates,

        46
        00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,175
        one of those solid,

        47
        00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,275
        energetic seminary graduates,

        48
        00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,840
        more than 1100 of them
        through the years,

        49
        00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,380
        who represent why
        Bethel seminary exists.

        50
        00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,245
        Men and women who know God's Word

        51
        00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,455
        and live their faith in
        real life situations,

        52
        00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,840
        who see the whole world and are

        53
        00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,880
        challenged to be
        servants and helpers.

        54
        00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,590
        Other models began jumping out on

        55
        00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,080
        place. As Darwin started
        her college career,

        56
        00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
        he wasn't consciously
        aware of how much

        57
        00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,310
        the students and professors at

        58
        00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,230
        Bethel would help shape our life.

        59
        00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,350
        Models of enthusiasm,
        discipline of reaching out,

        60
        00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,750
        of not giving that

        61
        00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,290
        are in competition and
        training it backwards.

        62
        00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,145
        As athletic director,
        George Henry, in football,

        63
        00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,480
        as in all of athletics,

        64
        00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,689
        what we're supposed to be
        about is winning and losing.

        65
        00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,050
        >> Winning is important
        to us and winning is fun.

        66
        00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,990
        And yet at baffle, we want
        to take it one step further.

        67
        00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,455
        What we want for our
        athletes is to grow as

        68
        00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,870
        spiritual and social beings

        69
        00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,595
        through the medium of athletics.

        70
        00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,920
        And thus we use athletics

        71
        00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,140
        at a vehicle in which to promote

        72
        00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
        this growth came that ethics is

        73
        00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,040
        a very important part of
        my life and pretty map.

        74
        00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,170
        We just, unquote,
        Islamic Christian came.

        75
        00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,295
        I really began to realize
        what a proper attitude when

        76
        00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:01,640
        Aboriginal man Matthew security

        77
        00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,730
        breaches that was desirable
        since the CQI birth,

        78
        00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,610
        the Kingdom of God and
        thread and all these things.

        79
        00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,740
        >> Modelling also comes through

        80
        00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,770
        strenuous rehearsals
        and glorious results,

        81
        00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,260
        whether at a home cancer in

        82
        00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,290
        orchestra hall or
        a European tour.

        83
        00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,570
        Models of creative expression,

        84
        00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,230
        of finding solutions
        through mastery of

        85
        00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,170
        complex machine and models

        86
        00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,790
        and the movements and attitudes

        87
        00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,380
        of over 2 thousand students

        88
        00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,315
        from all over the United States,

        89
        00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:57,125
        from mission fields in
        many countries abroad,

        90
        00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,170
        plus the patterns of learning and

        91
        00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,320
        experience demonstrated
        by Christian scholars.

        92
        00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,500
        The skilled men and women
        of the Bethel faculty,

        93
        00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,590
        highly competent in
        their academic field,

        94
        00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,410
        guided by the instruction
        of God's infallible,

        95
        00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,660
        we're committed to helping

        96
        00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,105
        their students to
        be old person's,

        97
        00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:19,580
        helping them to think and mature.

        98
        00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,320
        When I came to
        battle, I didn't have

        99
        00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,360
        any specific vocational goal.

        100
        00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,780
        It was scary enough to starting
        college and all I wanted

        101
        00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,395
        was a place where I could
        grow maybe for a year or two.

        102
        00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,619
        But before length and pretty
        specific direction began.

        103
        00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,930
        >> From the faculty. It started

        104
        00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,310
        with the basic communication,

        105
        00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,530
        quite a good combination of

        106
        00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,455
        students and stimulation
        from the professor.

        107
        00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,285
        As we talked about my interests,

        108
        00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,800
        he encouraged me to major in

        109
        00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,590
        communication and combine
        the Program in Writing.

        110
        00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,860
        Referred by contrast, Jeff
        Magnusson had clear cut

        111
        00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,280
        idea about who vocational
        future and found at

        112
        00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,270
        Bethel the write to them
        count reaches objected.

        113
        00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,190
        Four years ago, I came to about

        114
        00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,900
        a specific idea of entering

        115
        00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,030
        their pre-medical
        program and having

        116
        00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,590
        achieved my goal this last

        117
        00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,630
        fall and come to
        the conclusion that

        118
        00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,490
        bevels chemistry
        department provides

        119
        00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,740
        some of the best
        pre-medical nation.

        120
        00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,290
        You see all kinds of

        121
        00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,600
        positive interaction
        between students and

        122
        00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,210
        professors after class lecture

        123
        00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,030
        and frequent encounters
        along the battle con,

        124
        00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,880
        course in quiet conversations,

        125
        00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,305
        in times of prayer.

        126
        00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,020
        Part of the direction I
        received at Bethel came through

        127
        00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,960
        tough and even
        negative situation.

        128
        00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,530
        Sir, I wanted to be
        challenged academically.

        129
        00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,900
        That's one of the
        reasons I chose befor,

        130
        00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,650
        But I never dreamed how much
        my mind would be stretched.

        131
        00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,535
        Papers correction
        all the way through.

        132
        00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,200
        It's amazing how myth with

        133
        00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,105
        Michael thing can tell
        you what's wrong.

        134
        00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,190
        Challenge you to do better and

        135
        00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,765
        make you feel good
        about yourself too.

        136
        00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:59,950
        Think about the
        rough time ahead of

        137
        00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,625
        the freshmen in an organizational
        communication path.

        138
        00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,085
        I never worked so hard for

        139
        00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,000
        my light biotic string
        to the booth, to myself.

        140
        00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,610
        Confident, you know
        you're worth something.

        141
        00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,330
        When a professor cares enough
        about to demand the best

        142
        00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:23,665
        you can get into that.

        143
        00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:27,325
        Graduate studies require
        even greater discipline

        144
        00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,550
        and theological education
        is no exception.

        145
        00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,700
        Mirrored, Erickson is a
        professor in the seminary.

        146
        00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,220
        We're preparing people here
        who are going to be students

        147
        00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,990
        all their lives and who in

        148
        00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,679
        effect are going to add
        examinations every week.

        149
        00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,430
        >> Our Lord taught that the
        reward for working well

        150
        00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,610
        done and even greater
        responsibility to serve.

        151
        00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,690
        And as someone who says,

        152
        00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,965
        what have I done well,

        153
        00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,230
        what can I do even
        better so that I can

        154
        00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,570
        improve and grow in
        my usefulness to

        155
        00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,710
        the Lord and serve and

        156
        00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,805
        love the privilege of
        being a useful servant.

        157
        00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,620
        It comes from a deeper

        158
        00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,215
        personal understanding
        of God's Word.

        159
        00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,420
        The unchanging foundation of

        160
        00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,940
        learning at baffled the Bible,

        161
        00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,600
        the underlying
        textbook in every lab.

        164
        00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,080
        >> It's true through our goal as

        165
        00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,550
        a department of biblical
        and theological studies is

        166
        00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,480
        primarily to equip
        men and women with

        167
        00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,505
        the skills and tools

        168
        00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,640
        to be lifelong
        students of the Bible.

        169
        00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,360
        That just a devotional
        study of the Bible,

        170
        00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,285
        as important
        certainly as that is.

        171
        00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,944
        But bible study as a discipline,

        172
        00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:53,885
        academic rigorous study,

        173
        00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,975
        Scripture to the end that

        174
        00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,634
        these men and women find
        more fully know God's Word

        175
        00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,155
        >> The very beginning seminary

        176
        00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,660
        had been based on
        biblical studies.

        177
        00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,310
        All through the years,

        178
        00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,200
        we have been deeply
        concerned and a

        179
        00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,900
        strong emphasis in Bible study,

        180
        00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
        whether we teach courses
        like Christian education,

        181
        00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,915
        counseling, preaching,
        or social ethics.

        182
        00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:20,405
        The emphasis is on the bible.

        183
        00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,750
        Our model, the servant of God,

        184
        00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,190
        communicating the Word of God,

        185
        00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,270
        gives expression to it.

        186
        00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,925
        Because of our concern
        for the Bible.

        187
        00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:31,460
        When we began the work of battles

        188
        00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,830

        00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,325

        over the campus.

        190
        00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,660
        That wisdom, which comes

        191
        00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,730
        only through God's inspired Word,

        192
        00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,874
        is nurtured in daily chapel,

        194
        00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,115
        and in one-on-one encounters

        195
        00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,280
        as the Bible and its
        teachings penetrate

        196
        00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,130
        every aspect of life
        at Bethel so much

        part of the learning process?

        198
        00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,490
        How vital are the liberal arts

        199
        00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,055
        in this attention to
        the whole person?

        200
        00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,380
        A college degree can mean much

        201
        00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,410
        more than a better job
        and a higher salary.

        202
        00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,990
        A broad liberal arts education

        203
        00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,110
        helps provide for
        Creative Living.

        204
        00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,880
        Nerd had to be much
        more than the data.

        205
        00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,670
        We provide a broad
        background in November,

        206
        00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,129
        like well, I'd been

        207
        00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,590
        >> john graduated, repaired,

        208
        00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,560
        compassionate and caring
        and not just business

        209
        00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,675
        graduates with
        technical competent

        210
        00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,390
        looking to climb the
        corporate ladder,

        211
        00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,750
        but men and women with
        moral and spiritual fiber

        212
        00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,355
        able to articulate

        213
        00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,990
        a Christian perspective on

        214
        00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,635
        the complex issues in business,
        industry, and government.

        215
        00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,830
        And able to represent
        Christ in workplace.

        216
        00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,310
        Occasionally, those of us in
        seminary administration or

        217
        00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,640
        at what kind of background
        is best for ministry.

        218
        00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,520
        And of course, God leads
        individuals from every walk

        219
        00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,655
        of life and educational
        field into the seminary.

        220
        00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,819
        But because the needs and
        opportunities of ministry

        221
        00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:09,980
        >> so diverse. For example,

        222
        00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,310
        our seminary catalog speaks
        of providing a program

        223
        00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,765
        relevant to the context of
        contemporary church life.

        224
        00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,490
        That's why we
        encourage students to

        225
        00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,860
        be broadly educated
        and impossible

        226
        00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,740
        to delve into the
        humanities to gain

        227
        00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,545
        historical perspective and to

        228
        00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:31,190
        learn to handle language
        with every skill possible.

        229
        00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,030
        In other words, to be
        liberally educated.

        230
        00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,985
        As I think about
        my college years,

        231
        00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,740
        sometimes frightening as well

        232
        00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,580
        as I'm amazed that
        of the cabinet.

        233
        00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,925
        And certainly when I
        ended that Merkel intern

        234
        00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:50,150
        governors after filling part
        of the requirements for

        235
        00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,125
        my major oven helped
        me gain confidence.

        236
        00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,590
        And I found the more I gained
        and pamphlet The left.

        237
        00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,835
        I thought about myself

        238
        00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:01,145
        and became more
        concerned about others.

        239
        00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,920
        I learned that people
        are more important

        240
        00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,590
        than how I might do
        on a particular exam.

        241
        00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,200
        And I never did any work
        done, according Jeff,

        242
        00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,220
        because they tried to be
        a fat people caring about

        243
        00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,635
        people that are calling as

        244
        00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:19,910
        Christian surprise gift
        of a motorized chair.

        245
        00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,920
        So they do solace and could be

        246
        00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,470
        more independent. Welcome Week.

        247
        00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,630
        Volunteers buzzing around looking

        248
        00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,434
        for ways to be helpful. Residue

        249
        00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,270
        >> Open to students
        on their floor.

        250
        00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,260
        Blood donor, a fleet of
        students spending their summer,

        251
        00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,000
        needy areas of the world.

        252
        00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,550
        Inspiring for me to
        realize that while

        253
        00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,949
        our students are in
        training for ministry,

        254
        00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,130
        God chooses to use them
        in significant ways.

        255
        00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,710
        I think of George Syndrome
        came to be known as

        256
        00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,905
        Chicken George because
        while he was in Thailand,

        257
        00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,230
        he invented a portable
        Chicken group

        258
        00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,460
        that will allow the people

        259
        00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,150
        there to have Egg Producers
        and then eat the chickens.

        260
        00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,200
        To or think of triste Holland
        and Paul de Bernanke,

        261
        00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,310
        who climbed 20 thousand
        foot tall Mount McKinley

        262
        00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,930
        for a reason and much greater

        263
        00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,194
        than simply getting to the top.

        264
        00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,400
        >> There's nothing that
        my climbing partner isn't

        265
        00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,260
        I enjoy more than the prospect of

        266
        00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,910
        spending a month on a big Alaskan

        267
        00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,190
        mountain or with Mount McKinley,

        268
        00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,220
        It had to be more than just
        a client for fun and sport.

        269
        00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,920
        When we thought that it was
        possible to raise money to

        270
        00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,365
        help Cambodian refugees
        through world vision.

        271
        00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,920
        Because of our climb, it
        all became very worthwhile.

        272
        00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,684
        Purpose of bathroom is
        mapped to produce completion

        273
        00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,740
        >> intellectual customers.

        274
        00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,165
        Rather, it's to make our
        college and seminary graduates

        275
        00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:43,760
        uncomfortable enough to do

        276
        00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,550
        something about the prism
        shape of the world.

        277
        00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,470
        And we do all kinds
        of things to try and

        278
        00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,675
        get people to do what they
        don't really want to do.

        279
        00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:53,225
        But in the end, the
        motivating factor

        280
        00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,460
        is to understand
        the grace of God,

        281
        00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,570
        to have a responsive
        gratitude and to

        282
        00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,250
        demonstrate this gratitude by

        283
        00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,570
        doing what he wants us to do.

        284
        00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:29,930
        >> Being around anymore.
        I hear a lot about labor.

        285
        00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:39,860
        They were you worried
        about Latin for,

        286
        00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,975
        I know the play and have for

        287
        00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,840
        the Lord to give you a future.

        288
        00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,860
        Mm-hm.

        When I came back home,

        53
        00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,370
        that they will decide

        54
        00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,390
        And everybody in the neighbor,

        55
        00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,070
        they start to move because

        56
        00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,100
        the the Camaro soldier asked

        57

        us to leave the town
        only three day.

        58
        00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,160
        And that times many,

        59
        00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,070
        many people on the street.

        60
        00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,755
        And we cannot get
        out from the place.

        61
        00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:50,180
        So we decide to stay

        62
        00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,650
        one night and a house
        and a nice morning.

        It's not all belonging.

        64
        00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:02,450
        Take along wet because
        I thought that

        65
        00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,930
        we can come back to
        the city about 33 day.

        66
        00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,430
        So we just take some of
        belonging along with that.

        67
        00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:17,510
        And the morning of
        April 181975, I care.

        68
        00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,645
        Where did you go when you
        whack Phnom Penh, Sorry.

        69
        00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:23,945
        I went with my friend
        that I live with them,

        70
        00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:32,150
        goes south to Japan,

        71
        00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:41,545

        to the is of plumping city.

        72
        00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:44,305
        And then may decide
        to stay there.

        73
        00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:48,370
        But generally, we can't
        stay because they come

        74
        00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,810
        out or sold yet tried to

        75
        00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,750
        pause to move
        farther and farther.

        76
        00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,570
        And the when to one
        place they call not up

        77
        00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:05,690
        from about ten kilo meter
        from non-being city.

        78
        00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,450
        At that time, were soldiers
        guarding over you or

        79
        00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,040
        were you allowed to move

        80
        00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,125
        freely on your own
        with your friend?

        81
        00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,470
        In my area, they
        allow me to go so

        82
        00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,310
        only it cannot go
        different direction.

        83
        00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,440
        Okay. What happened
        after all of this?

        84
        00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,530
        Then? I stay there about
        a month and then know,

        85
        00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,935
        tend to go back to the city.

        86
        00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:38,225
        And then my friend
        and I decide to

        87
        00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:41,660
        leave and make decision to

        88

        my hometown is bottom bar.

        90
        00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,540
        So I wanted to go
        to see my pattern.

        Yeah. That's 20 years old.

        5
        00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:32,650
        20. Okay. Now, okay.

        6
        00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,434
        You were you able to make
        it travel to bottom Bond?

        7
        00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:40,179
        Did you did you eventually
        arrive in Battambang to see

        8
        00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,680
        your family or did they
        stop you before then?

        9
        00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,275
        No. They they try to stop me
        and my friend along the way.

        10
        00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:57,395
        But yes, to not lie to them
        and make them want to stay

        11
        00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,644
        at a different place like that

        12
        00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:04,220
        because I did not know
        any body know relative.

        13
        00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,715
        So just trying to get away.

        14
        00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:11,495
        But I cannot at that time.

        15
        00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:14,975
        That's why the last

        16
        00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:19,804
        stop that I stay in
        Kampala, Tom problem,

        17
        00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:24,590

        me that the relay

        18
        00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,424
        is separate between same
        ramp and couple of thumb.

        19
        00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,920
        Okay. Now was a village

        20
        00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,350
        that was established by the
        Khmer Rouge or was this

        21
        00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,419
        an existence because of the
        Khmer Rouge came to visit

        22
        00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:43,834
        the existing village that
        along the highway numbers say.

        23
        00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:48,845
        Okay. How long did
        you remain there?

        24
        00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:52,264
        I stayed there until
        the Vietnamese

        25
        00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:58,505
        came in January ninth, 1979.

        26
        00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:04,174
        Okay. Whether many Khmer
        Rouge soldiers there,

        27
        00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,395
        not so many there,

        28
        00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:08,225
        but that their latest,

        29
        00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:11,540
        the, at the old place that

        30
        00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:19,559
        the commando capture
        during 1970 occur.

        31
        00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,100
        How many, how many of you were

        32
        00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,304
        there that were being guarded or,

        33
        00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:29,795
        or held there by the Khmer Rouge.

        34
        00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:36,305
        The people that while
        alone at that time,

        35
        00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:40,504
        as I remember, has
        about 200 people.

        36
        00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:44,300
        And they let us stay there.

        37
        00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,220
        And then they put
        lay one family one.

        38
        00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,420
        How would they call

        39
        00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,514
        the old people to leave
        with them so they can

        40
        00:02:54,514 --> 00:03:00,560
        provide shout and some
        food or material.

        41
        00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,915
        A little bit hard
        to live with them.

        42
        00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,884
        Okay. Now, what do you
        mean by the wrong people?

        43
        00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,690
        That mean the people
        that live that

        44
        00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,200
        the Camaro before the Khmer

        45
        00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,795
        captured the whole Cambodia Care.

        46
        00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,199
        Okay. Were you in a household

        47
        00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,940
        with another family or with

        48
        00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,040
        your friend or who did you ever?

        49
        00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,124
        I live with my friend and
        his wife, two children.

        50
        00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:32,390
        Okay. Now, while you
        were living here,

        51
        00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,930
        do they have you do

        52
        00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,335

        do during the day?

        53
        00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:40,479
        Yes. They said nato.

        54
        00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,405
        Let them right away
        then the next day.

        55
        00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,760
        Okay. And what kind of
        work do they have you?

        56
        00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:55,435
        Do? They send me to live with
        the to date the bloody car,

        57
        00:03:55,435 --> 00:04:00,280
        like a small stream that
        file from the place

        58
        00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,350

        in the flawed I sub

        60
        00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,984
        And here were these
        irrigation ditches?

        61
        00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:14,105
        Yeah. Okay. What other kinds
        of work do they have you do?

        62
        00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:16,489
        Just the first time?

        63
        00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,589
        Will they introduce us as

        64
        00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,515
        a No people come to
        live in the village

        65
        00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:27,514
        and they tie lake
        a very cheerful,

        66
        00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:30,350
        trying to make us happy
        to leave with them.

        67
        00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,494
        And they asked us to help.

        68
        00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,899
        Little whatever they've
        been assigned to

        69
        00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:39,560
        do, Hokkaido will occur.

        70
        00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,964
        So we're most of the tasks
        agricultural planting?

        71
        00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,919
        Yes. Okay. Today, were you

        72
        00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,504
        involved with road construction,
        anything like that?

        73
        00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,259
        Mostly agricultural tasks?

        74
        00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,009
        No. The first three months just

        75
        00:04:55,009 --> 00:05:00,530
        only taking irrigation
        water plan for that place.

        76
        00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,519
        And then after three months,

        77
        00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,160
        they send us mad
        because that time is

        78
        00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,294
        the time to plan race.

        79
        00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:13,669
        So they send us mat and
        we cannot do anymore.

        80
        00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,970
        I'm going to have to heavy rain.

        81
        00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,730
        So let's come back to
        the village trying to

        82
        00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,399
        plan to help the other
        people. Don't care.

        83
        00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,339
        How, what would be a
        typical workday in terms

        84
        00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,220
        of in terms of the amount of
        time that you would work,

        85
        00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,020
        when would you start
        in the morning

        86
        00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,060
        and end at the end of the day.

        87
        00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,105
        First year that the
        Khmer Rouge took over.

        88
        00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,789
        The work hours not really tie

        89
        00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,615
        like the old farmer used to work.

        90
        00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,699
        In the morning. We get up,

        91
        00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,250
        usually have a tiny plate first

        92
        00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,499
        a little bit and start to go to

        93
        00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:56,915
        the feel about nine AM
        and until the sunset.

        94
        00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:00,139
        Combat home. Okay. That
        was the first year.

        95
        00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,735
        They did things
        change after there.

        96
        00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:06,050
        And then Neitzsche
        years they start

        97
        00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,839
        to trying to push people to

        98
        00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,990
        the mall by trying

        99
        00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,399
        to wake up people early in

        100
        00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,934
        the morning and go to the feel.

        101
        00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:23,315
        Okay. What time do you
        think that that was?

        102
        00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,549
        When when they would have you

        103
        00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,504
        sent you out to the
        fields to start working?

        104
        00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:32,509
        Nominee that they don't
        have time and I don't know,

        105
        00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,590
        but is it the sunrise on
        everybody and need to get up.

        106
        00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,470
        Ok. And was that was that

        107
        00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,374
        the way the workday

        108
        00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:43,144
        went for the rest of the
        time you were there?

        109
        00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:45,245
        Sunrise to sunset?
        Yeah, absolutely.

        110
        00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:48,740
        Sometime when the out they need

        111
        00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,309
        to finish and then
        they don't have

        112
        00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,559
        enough time to do the push
        that to live at night

        113
        00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:59,690
        to become home and a little bit,

        114
        00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,849
        and then we must go back again.

        115
        00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:07,130
        Okay. I've heard that,

        116
        00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,619
        that they would have
        educational seminars

        117
        00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:12,679
        to to learn the
        philosophy of Pol Pot.

        118
        00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,750
        Did they do that at,

        119
        00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,180
        at your village where you stayed?

        120
        00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,350
        Jealously? They do
        at the lunchtime.

        121
        00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,090
        When people have a break.

        122
        00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,175
        After eating a little bit,

        123
        00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:30,889
        the group leader choose
        to give some advice

        124
        00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,990
        and trying to ask about

        125
        00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,300
        the background for the new people

        126
        00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,504
        that come to live in the VLA.

        127
        00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:43,325
        And sometime they do at NIH
        after we finished split,

        128
        00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:46,099
        they obey, asked to
        have a meeting to learn

        129
        00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,625
        about the that new philosophy.

        130
        00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,559
        Was that usually every,

        131
        00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,484
        every day, that that
        would take place.

        132
        00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,930
        The first years, not every day,

        133
        00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,945
        but kind like a
        almost every week.

        134
        00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,950
        Okay.

        135
        00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,054
        Did did they

        136
        00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:16,159
        ask you about your
        background at all?

        137
        00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,250
        They did. Okay. But I lie.

        138
        00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,184
        And what would you tell them?

        139
        00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:26,165
        I told them I was a stone
        and they believe it

        140
        00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,340
        because I was young
        that time and I'm

        141
        00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,160
        not married and I was
        not meant at that time.

        142
        00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,469
        What would happen if you
        told them your background?

        143
        00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,454
        When I was there
        the first few Day,

        144
        00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:42,050
        the people that I live with,

        145
        00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,069
        they told me how to sit,

        146
        00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:51,349
        Why don't tell
        everything to truth.

        147
        00:08:51,349 --> 00:09:00,620
        And because they have that
        family have some feeling,

        148
        00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,415
        one to help us to survive
        during that time.

        149
        00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:13,354
        So they told her to destroy
        all kind of identification.

        150
        00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:18,619
        Some work may be that
        I brought with us,

        151
        00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:22,370
        gave to the people that
        because they don't

        152
        00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,450
        have paper to roll the tobacco.

        153
        00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,429
        So as good as you
        gave it to them,

        154
        00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:31,650
        you don't keep it.
        That mean safe.

        155
        00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,730
        If you what about

        156
        00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,565
        your background would make
        them suspicious of you?

        157
        00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:43,505
        Would it be because
        you were a police?

        158
        00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:46,520
        Policemen and at
        Phnom Penh city or or

        159
        00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,590
        because of your family background

        160
        00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,670
        in terms of your parents

        161
        00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,940
        were shopkeepers or what
        would it be that they are

        162
        00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,140
        the Khmer Rouge would
        not like to commando,

        163
        00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,004
        don't like people in the office.

        164
        00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:03,379
        And also they don't lie to
        people that have lice can lie.

        165
        00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:08,240
        My stop. They all they
        accused SLS alike.

        166
        00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,209
        Vietnamese, all the ethnic group.

        167
        00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,965
        We are not really pill
        a 100% Cambodian.

        168
        00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:24,804
        Okay. Your experience there,

        169
        00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,584
        did you yourself,

        170
        00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,120
        were you ever subjected
        to physical abuse

        171
        00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,320
        or abused in any way while
        you were in the village?

        172
        00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,575
        Boat? They have physical abuse,

        173
        00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:45,125
        have a mentally or
        mental abuse. He had.

        174
        00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,110
        The Khmer Rouge tend to

        175
        00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,080
        eliminate the people from

        176
        00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,869
        the city because they accuse us.

        177
        00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,080
        A strange person that
        never were and a farm and

        178
        00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,804
        the person that always take
        advantage over the farmer.

        179
        00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:09,535
        Because of the Khmer Rouge.

        180
        00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,955
        Most of them the farmer.

        181
        00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:18,954
        And they have a background
        that very low education.

        182
        00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:22,270
        And they don't like
        the city people

        183
        00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,634
        that used to take
        Atlantic from them.

        184
        00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:30,054
        And then it kind like
        we went for them.

        185
        00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:33,504
        But I don't know about
        the tomato philosophy.

        186
        00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:38,379
        But this is yes,
        only the the feeling

        187
        00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,310
        that I feel that time.

        188
        00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,240
        Did you were you yourself,

        189
        00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,530
        personally subjected to any
        abuse by the Khmer Rouge?

        190
        00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,349
        Yeah. What can you
        do you remember

        191
        00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:55,475
        any specific incidents
        that occur at one time?

        192
        00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,365
        They said me too.

        193
        00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:03,605
        We're at to trying
        to make a water dam.

        194
        00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:15,120
        And the they call Stan sign
        as part of a not Cambodia.

        195
        00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,389
        And that tiny from sunrise to

        196
        00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,209
        sunset and then come to

        197
        00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,779
        the borough that they
        bill for a to slip.

        198
        00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,429
        And when the work is
        not done on time,

        199
        00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,669
        they asked us to work
        at NIH after dinner.

        200
        00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,650
        Most of the time, they did not

        201
        00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,034
        allow us to come to
        the burrow to eat.

        202
        00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,675
        They have the cook

        203
        00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:49,714
        that brought the Dina to
        the place that we work.

        204
        00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:53,660
        And then they are
        just distribute each

        205
        00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,489
        played for us to eat for a
        while above half an hour,

        206
        00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:02,405
        and then they start plus two

        207
        00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:07,759
        again until ten or 11:00 PM
        until midnight sometime.

        208
        00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,549
        And their philosophy,

        209
        00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,245
        the people that the leader
        when they saw did not fitness.

        210
        00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:19,789
        Even that posts that

        211
        00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,534
        tiny our hardware
        that did not finish.

        212
        00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,859
        And then they start a new idea.

        213
        00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:28,759
        Say, Daddy, why a piece of land?

        214
        00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,580
        If you dig it fast,

        215
        00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,795
        you can get finished.

        216
        00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:36,080
        Their part that they
        gave it to her to do.

        217
        00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,094
        You can go to the
        broad sleep early.

        218
        00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:41,120
        And some people are trying to do

        219
        00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,890
        that to get faster
        and then so they can

        220
        00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,530
        have time come back
        to have a lat of

        221
        00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,045
        find something to aid because

        222
        00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,220
        they don't have
        enough food to eat.

        223
        00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,199
        And later on people,

        224
        00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,455
        but I'm trying too hard
        to finish their part.

        225
        00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:59,060
        And then they increase the
        portion of work load so

        226
        00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,589
        until nobody can finish
        before the one at the combat.

        227
        00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,529
        Do Do you recall

        228
        00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,419
        any incidents witnessing any
        incidents where where people

        229
        00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:22,970
        were killed or just disappeared
        or beaten at that time.

        230
        00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,459
        And 197 needs seven,

        231
        00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,720
        same one of my friend

        232
        00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,019
        when two were from the same
        village and he disappear.

        233
        00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:38,839
        I don't know what the reason why.

        234
        00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,984
        Because they accuse
        him that he's not very

        235
        00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:52,774
        active that trying to
        against their philosophy.

        236
        00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:57,694
        But actually he's
        really tired his sakes.

        237
        00:14:57,694 --> 00:15:02,389
        He got diarrhea and he went

        238
        00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:04,849
        into the the forest

        239
        00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:08,464
        nearby because he got diary,
        he cannot stay there.

        240
        00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:12,559
        And they accuse him that
        trying to get away from birth.

        241
        00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,085
        And later on, after that night,

        242
        00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,274
        next day, we didn't see him.

        243
        00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,479
        And they're told
        that they send him

        244
        00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,849
        back to the village pub.

        245
        00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,259
        When we came back after we

        246
        00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,420
        finished work over
        there about six months.

        247
        00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,325
        I didn't see him at our

        248
        00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:31,309
        so I don't know
        where they take it.

        249
        00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,545
        Did this happen very often

        250
        00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,509
        where people would
        disappear like that?

        251
        00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,300
        Usely, it happened to the people

        252
        00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,785
        that a blanket from the city.

        253
        00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:46,745
        But for the people
        they call all people,

        254
        00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,210
        they tend to try and

        255
        00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,474
        to that we educate them or
        send them to let them place.

        256
        00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,469
        Okay. So you're feeling is

        257
        00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:00,559
        that if one was
        identified as has,

        258
        00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,360
        having lived in the city,

        259
        00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,339
        that the Khmer Rouge would try

        260
        00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,229
        to systematically break them

        261
        00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:11,789
        down and ultimately
        killed them. Yeah. Okay.

        262
        00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:21,240
        We're As far as

        263
        00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,065
        the deaths of of people
        in that village,

        264
        00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,150
        was it usually the case

        265
        00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,609
        where violence was
        involved or was it a case

        266
        00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:36,035
        of just disappearances and
        also perhaps starving people,

        267
        00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,119
        and they would just
        break down and die

        268
        00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,579
        from illness or,
        or a lack of food.

        269
        00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,484
        Did that happen more frequently?

        270
        00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,179
        Almost everyday.

        271
        00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:50,014
        People that die by lacking a
        full and also the illness,

        272
        00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:52,370
        they common disease is

        273
        00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,330
        diarrhea and starvation because

        274
        00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,294
        they don't have
        enough food to eat.

        275
        00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:03,980
        And some people die by accusing.

        276
        00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,349
        Are there background?

        277
        00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,074
        If they found out live?

        278
        00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,464
        My friend, he was the pilot.

        279
        00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:18,844
        And the reason that they
        know him because he brought

        280
        00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:26,240
        a if made at that time when
        he was in Phnom Penh city,

        281
        00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,830
        he had irwin made as

        282
        00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,204
        that allele girl
        about 1010 years old.

        283
        00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:34,100
        And she's the real Cambodian

        284
        00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,130
        cared because see have
        a different math skin.

        285
        00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,329
        And he brought
        Herbert and told her

        286
        00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:45,184
        because that time her
        parent was separate,

        287
        00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:47,795
        B cannot leave her alone.

        288
        00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:50,525
        And she wanted to
        come along when when

        289
        00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:53,914
        he took her with
        two layered there,

        290
        00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:57,079
        they look at is not
        like a relative or

        291
        00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,460
        threatened or something
        because of the appearance.

        292
        00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,360
        And later on, that
        girl, when she grow up,

        293
        00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,990
        see toll everything
        about our background

        294
        00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,890
        that she news than they found out

        295
        00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:20,735
        that he was pilot and
        they tried to kill him.

        296
        00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:28,414
        But he tried to make it
        work as hard as he can to

        297
        00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:32,610
        fulfill their

        298
        00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,635
        what is say, their commitment.

        299
        00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:43,190
        But one day they make

        300
        00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,615
        a the whole relate chain

        301
        00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:52,205
        by moving people from one
        relate to another really.

        302
        00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:56,195
        And that time is the time
        that the more people

        303
        00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:00,319
        the access to Pat and unmute
        during that NIH, no warning.

        304
        00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,435
        So at the at night,

        305
        00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:04,549
        that night they told
        everybody need to

        306
        00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,639
        Pat and to move to another
        village because that,

        307
        00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:12,199
        that the new will need more
        people to finish their work.

        308
        00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:15,799
        And then they send
        them through DNA.

        309
        00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,170
        And later on I found out that he

        310
        00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,990
        die because I saw
        belonging that they

        311
        00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,800
        took from them and distributed
        to their old people to use

        312
        00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,244
        that little girl that
        that lived with him?

        313
        00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:32,960
        I did. Who did she live

        314
        00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,795
        with after they move
        to the nowadays?

        315
        00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:39,695
        Her they took her to live
        with death and family.

        316
        00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:44,345
        Okay. Because the have
        some problem fighting,

        317
        00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,565
        arguing because at the food,

        318
        00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,340
        not enough food to eat
        and people tried to set

        319
        00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,730
        Y and they steal from
        each ADA to eat.

        320
        00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,620
        And then they saw that we

        321
        00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,115
        have in the night that and
        then they split family.

        322
        00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:02,869
        Even myself, I split to lay
        that defend family and he,

        323
        00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,675
        that his widely different family.

        324
        00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:07,559
        Okay.

        325
        00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,089
        So was 1979

        326
        00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:20,480
        when the Vietnamese
        invaded Cambodia,

        327
        00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,199
        was the first time you
        fled from the village.

        328
        00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,749
        Were there ever other incidents

        329
        00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:31,865
        that they I I thought
        the Vietnamese.

        330
        00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:36,544
        Came by because I live
        near the highway.

        331
        00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:38,660
        And I saw that and

        332
        00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,400
        all the Khmer Rouge leader

        333
        00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,519
        escape the night before
        because they knew they

        334
        00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,550
        have a radio that
        they can listen to

        335
        00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,559
        the news through the radio

        336
        00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
        and also the, the escape before.

        337
        00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,489
        So this only the population

        338
        00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,739
        that live in the
        village stay there.

        339
        00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:58,909
        So the next day I saw the
        Vietnamese troop came by and

        340
        00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:03,485
        everybody thought that the
        Cambodia was freeze again.

        341
        00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:06,139
        And then everybody
        trying to get into

        342
        00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,174
        the fear to grab our
        rice that we can to

        343
        00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:13,819
        protect so we can live for

        344
        00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:18,814
        while until we know what's
        going on in the country.

        345
        00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:25,309
        And I live with the family
        that I stayed there.

        346
        00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,015
        The whole during that

        347
        00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:32,359
        Camaro tried to help
        them to collect.

        348
        00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,890
        Are the right, keep it.

        349
        00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,740
        You get about a 100 pound

        350
        00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,184
        or something like that. Keep it.

        351
        00:21:39,184 --> 00:21:41,165
        And one week later,

        352
        00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:42,980
        I made decision because

        353
        00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,260
        that time a lot of
        people start moving to

        354
        00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,039
        their own town and

        355
        00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,240
        they asked them that I'm
        going to see my parents.

        356
        00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,284
        And one week later I left.

        357
        00:21:56,284 --> 00:22:00,574
        I travel almost about

        358
        00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:04,850
        two weeks and I reached
        to my hometown.

        359
        00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,505
        But when it yeah,
        that the other firm.

        360
        00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:10,535
        Okay. Were you able to
        locate your parents?

        361
        00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:13,819
        I know that and that
        time my parents did

        362
        00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,180
        not escape from the
        Khmer Rouge yet because

        363
        00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,780
        she was a bucket to add

        364
        00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,740
        new or different village
        from my home town.

        the my my old hometown,

        368
        00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,335
        I saw only my my cousin

        369
        00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:42,845
        and the ADA relative
        summed up my parents.

        Your parents, brother and sister.

        371
        00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,519
        Were they all sit together
        to the same village?

        372
        00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,590
        I didn't know, but they say that

        373
        00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,820
        the first year they send
        altogether and later on,

        374
        00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,759
        my brother's split
        up from them because

        375
        00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,014
        of the economic No,

        376
        00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,474
        not enough food to eat so much,

        377
        00:23:04,474 --> 00:23:08,719
        fled to the other area
        trying to live by himself.

        378
        00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:15,274
        And that time, my pen worth
        got how are my brother?

        379
        00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:20,640

        got home before them.

        382
        00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,449
        House was at near bottom mouth,

        383
        00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,890
        about 15 kilo meter
        from Baltimore City

        384
        00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,875
        along Highway phi k.

        385
        00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:39,230
        What was the name of that
        village they call compound.

        386
        00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,119
        And when the
        vietnamese took over,

        387
        00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,615

        Vietnamese to tame the Camaro,

        particular location

        404
        00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:58,820

        would throw bodies in well,

        408
        00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,409
        was that they call it a day.

        Okay. A diff this that
        little foot for the okay.

        412
        00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,645
        were struck by lightning?

        413
        00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:32,189
        Okay. And how long did you
        remain and bottom bar?

        416
        00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,184
        And two weeks later,

        417
        00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:51,004
        my mother and my sister got out.

        418
        00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:54,574
        They both get out
        from the tomorrows.

        419
        00:25:54,574 --> 00:26:00,559
        And then she returned to meet
        me in my hometown again,

        422
        00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,095
        And we don't think that we can

        423
        00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:15,800
        live because I have
        no full nothing.

        424
        00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,370
        So my mom and my sister and

        425
        00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,264
        my brother decide to
        escape to Thailand.

        426
        00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:31,200
        During the man now, between
        May and June and that time,

        427
        00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,640
        when I reach Thailand,

        428
        00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,709
        cam allowed the border.

        429
        00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:39,590
        The carlo Non Jan cam.

        430
        00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,280
        I'm a stay there a by two.

        431
        00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,654
        We at that time,

        432
        00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:49,910
        the ties government brought

        433
        00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,135
        all of the refugee
        ban because are

        434
        00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:58,310
        no international supervision
        in that cam and too

        435
        00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,934
        proud and ties government

        436
        00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:05,629
        just lie to a saying that they
        will move to a new place.

        437
        00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:10,639
        But actually they put us
        on a bus in the morning.

        438
        00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:13,910
        And they draw was, are they RNA?

        439
        00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:20,179
        Three, the destination is
        the not psi of Cambodia.

        440
        00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,024
        Along the border.

        441
        00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:24,725
        And in the morning the sun dry,

        442
        00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:26,990
        they start to push
        or to walk across

        443
        00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,229
        the border into Cambodia, psi.

        444
        00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:33,829
        And that time, a lot of people

        445
        00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:37,610
        die because of the
        mine along the border.

        446
        00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,924
        No. Where was the train?

        447
        00:27:40,924 --> 00:27:45,050
        Was this mountain slopes
        and PD-L1 they call numb.

        448
        00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:54,094
        But Evie here that the the
        the heavily cliff Hang on.

        449
        00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:55,970
        Cambodian psi. But from

        450
        00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,315
        the Thailand is
        like a plane fear.

        451
        00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:04,215
        Mmm. So people were literally
        pushed to their deaths.

        452
        00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:10,869
        Most people that were across
        early in the morning,

        453
        00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:14,650
        most of them die
        because of the mind.

        454
        00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,904
        And the mind just blow
        when all day long.

        455
        00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,290
        Because people didn't know.

        456
        00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,924
        They just abandoned.

        457
        00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:24,024
        And my family.

        458
        00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:29,214
        But my relative, about 30
        people decide to stay,

        459
        00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:34,479
        do not want to run back
        to Cambodia until that

        460
        00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,044
        the Thai soldier just till

        461
        00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:40,209
        the garden trying to show that.

        462
        00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,360
        And then we decide to
        leave the last Chan.

        463
        00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,544
        And I stay alone that water

        464
        00:28:46,544 --> 00:28:51,395
        because the hurdle too many
        mind-blowing that time.

        465
        00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:53,719
        So we decide to stay thereby, we,

        466
        00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:57,229
        without food and
        water, that we drink,

        467
        00:28:57,229 --> 00:29:01,699
        the water that just flow
        along with the body,

        468
        00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,504
        the sunlight than for one week.

        469
        00:29:04,504 --> 00:29:08,194
        And later on, we
        saw the Vietnamese

        470
        00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:11,779
        true came by and help to get out.

        471
        00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:14,389
        So we bwa followed their pad,

        472
        00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,015
        go back to Cambodia.

        473
        00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,874
        And where we're in Cambodia.

        474
        00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:22,380
        Did you go to I

        475
        00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,840
        about to mine back to
        my home village again.

        476
        00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,514
        And how long did you
        stay in bottom mom?

        477
        00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:42,235
        I lived there until 198219 a2.

        478
        00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:48,699
        And then I escape again.
        During that period.

        479
        00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,829
        What were you doing in

        480
        00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:55,400
        Battambang, roughly
        between 791982?

        481
        00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,004
        I start with the communication

        482
        00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,510
        and transport department in

        483
        00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:15,439
        Guatemala City as
        the regular employee

        484
        00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:20,939
        because I do not want anybody
        knows about my background.

        485
        00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:31,219
        And after a year later than 1980,

        486
        00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,935
        I was Yeah.

        487
        00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:36,979
        That's close to 81.

        488
        00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:39,950
        And I moved to we're in

        489
        00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,859
        the office because they
        know that I can do

        490
        00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,585
        some paperwork in the office

        491
        00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:46,309
        and my friend was there and they

        492
        00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:50,809
        know me before senate
        work in the office.

        493
        00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,814
        As the bookkeeping to make

        494
        00:30:54,814 --> 00:31:00,019
        no finer were less
        for the employee.

        495
        00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:04,165
        Key salaries, something like
        that and keep that alkyne,

        496
        00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:07,054
        our ration that
        permits no money yet.

        497
        00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:10,354
        They make a list and H MAN,

        498
        00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:13,085
        they provide some food ration.

        499
        00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:16,200
        So each employee can get rough.

        00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,860
        At? My job is the typing,
        the employee idlis,

        10
        00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,660
        and then Phyllis,
        all that were and

        11
        00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:55,145
        then have all the administrator
        sign on that list.

        12
        00:00:55,145 --> 00:01:01,400
        And then we take the let's
        go to the bank to get money.

        13
        00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,130
        Because we start to have money.

        14
        00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:11,585
        I think around 1980 is the
        new government in Cambodia.

        15
        00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:16,445
        They start to have money for
        people to spend that time

        16
        00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:22,790
        and then be my job to
        help to make the list.

        17
        00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,650
        Okay. Did you have

        18
        00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,915
        any other jobs while

        19
        00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:29,600
        during this period
        before you left again?

        20
        00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:41,000
        No. Highlights and end till
        1982 in June. June 1982.

        21
        00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,630
        Okay. What what was it
        like in bottom bog with,

        22
        00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,929
        with a new occupation,

        23
        00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,445
        new people in power,

        24
        00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,700
        whether still incidents
        of of abuses of

        25
        00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,165
        power or were things fairly
        stable, fairly calm.

        26
        00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:01,230
        What was it like there?

        27
        00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,360
        The new ghetto men?

        28
        00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,730
        It deal.

        29
        00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,800
        Keep looking. The people
        that have connected

        30
        00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:23,180
        with some get shiny background.

        31
        00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,390
        And also the one to know

        32
        00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,810
        about the background
        of the employee

        33
        00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:37,310
        before you can get in to work
        in the office or whatever.

        34
        00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,714
        They are. They asked
        about the background,

        35
        00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:44,090
        writing like a resume,

        36
        00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,665
        but I dare not trust them.

        37
        00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:49,609
        Still Hi my identity.

        38
        00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:54,120
        I didn't tell anybody except
        my friend at no, before.

        39
        00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,005
        Were were people
        are being picked up

        40
        00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,300
        where detention camps being still

        41
        00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,135
        in existence in
        Cambodia that time?

        42
        00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:10,534
        Yeah. They asked
        all the employees

        43
        00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:16,834
        go to training lake every two
        the same they'd tomorrow's.

        44
        00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:23,450
        But they gave us some freedom
        to do something by their

        45
        00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,765
        own because they didn't hold

        46
        00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:32,000
        a common kitchen
        or As a two-word,

        47
        00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,015
        as that grew up in
        a village anymore.

        48
        00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,595
        So we can do whatever V1.

        49
        00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,980
        But if the people that don't

        50
        00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,770
        have enough resources to those,

        51
        00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,345
        the crop or something
        like that that relates,

        52
        00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:50,180
        that relates leader provides

        53
        00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,270
        subnet and the ASA
        to work as a team,

        54
        00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,019
        but similar to the
        tomatoes before.

        55
        00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,330
        Now, you stated that you you

        56
        00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,760
        laughed Cambodia in June of 1982.

        57
        00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,660
        Yeah. Why did you
        leave at that time?

        58
        00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,510
        Was did something happen
        to you want to if we

        59
        00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,565
        or I have some pressure from work

        60
        00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:18,320
        because I feel that people trying

        61
        00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,070
        to dating to find
        out the background,

        62
        00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,805
        my background because 11 time

        63
        00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:34,050
        I was selected to go to study.

        64
        00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,645
        And the people in that
        department select myself.

        65
        00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,120
        But the other trend that we're

        66
        00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,080
        going to go to learn how to,

        67
        00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,540
        because they create a new
        department called taxation.

        68
        00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,885
        And know that I can go
        they see like me to go.

        69
        00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,300
        But before I can go,

        70
        00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,395
        I need to have background checks.

        71
        00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:07,835
        My name was sent to the office.

        72
        00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:13,370
        They call as the Cambodian
        what they call carrier lie.

        73
        00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,240
        Just doesn't that mean
        the appointment office.

        74
        00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,190
        Before they can appoint you to

        75
        00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,560
        go you need to go
        through that office,

        76
        00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
        the check our background.

        77
        00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,560
        They come to look at
        physical and they look at

        78
        00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,515
        your face trying to ask

        79
        00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:33,845
        or their friend about
        the background.

        80
        00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:37,729
        And I went through that process.

        81
        00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,290
        I fail because they look at they

        82
        00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,930
        say I have some kind of

        83
        00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,560
        a Chinese ethnic and
        they don't trust it.

        84
        00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,225
        Okay. And the other friend
        a path they can go.

        85
        00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:57,950
        Okay. Now, what did that mean
        than if they failed you,

        86
        00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,175
        that that meant that you
        didn't get that opportunity.

        87
        00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:04,445
        But did that mean they might
        come after you then later?

        88
        00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:06,380
        I didn't know at that time,

        89
        00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,575
        but I feel that it's
        not safe to stay.

        90
        00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:14,330
        And also my relative have

        91
        00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,075
        some problem in my hometown

        92
        00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:20,525
        because they knew that
        IVR escaped before,

        93
        00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:24,890
        during 1979 or my
        family that escape it.

        94
        00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,440
        And we don't want to,

        95
        00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,605
        we're in the farm to feel again.

        96
        00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,740
        So am I trying to escape?

        97
        00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,070
        So the last time a escape
        it my way because I got

        98
        00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,355
        married and in November 1981

        99
        00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:47,060
        and I escaped with my
        wife and my wife URL.

        100
        00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:54,785
        Pattern and her sibling and
        also my mother and my sister,

        101
        00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:57,260
        except my brother, that

        102
        00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,555
        he got married and
        her two children.

        103
        00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,060
        He cannot escape at that time.

        104
        00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,985
        So he decided to stay.

        105
        00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:10,740
        Ok. And how long did it take
        you to get to the border?

        106
        00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,995
        From bottom bond to border?

        107
        00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:18,965
        Only one day.

        108
        00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:21,905
        Did you have any problems
        crossing the border?

        109
        00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,425
        How would happen?

        110
        00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:26,840
        I gotta arrest one time.

        111
        00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,430
        They put me in jail.

        112
        00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,690
        They call seize upon.

        113
        00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,230
        They arrested you
        and put you in jail.

        114
        00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,270
        What happened? How
        long were you in jail?

        115
        00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,090
        Only one day, window in
        the morning and then

        116
        00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,540
        laid a learning my pattern,

        117
        00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,510
        just negotiate the
        people over there,

        118
        00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,200
        tried to bribe them to get
        me and my life outlet that.

        119
        00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,345
        Okay. And then we come back to

        120
        00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:54,850
        bite them both to live for
        about a couple of months.

        121
        00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,740
        And I made lately again.

        122
        00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,640
        While you were in jail,

        123
        00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,160
        did anything did
        they interrogate you

        124
        00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,610
        or abuse you in any way?

        125
        00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,450
        Because it's only one day
        that didn't do anything yet.

        126
        00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,060
        They just put me at the
        dyadic people matter.

        127
        00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,590
        Okay. You return to bottom bond.

        128
        00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,130
        You were there for two more
        months and then you yes.

        129
        00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,465
        About to learn.

        130
        00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:26,420
        Okay. And then I escape
        again because I'm

        131
        00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,510
        afraid I have some
        problem with that.

        132
        00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,340
        And then next time that IS
        that last time I escape?

        133
        00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,515
        A yes.

        134
        00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,410
        Highest somebody
        trying to help me

        135
        00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,980
        to go through the Alone the way.

        136
        00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,490
        Did you go by yourself
        or did you go

        137
        00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,260
        with the same group of people?

        138
        00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,580
        The same people but a
        little bit different time.

        139
        00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,685
        Okay. While you were in
        Battambang that last time,

        140
        00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,755
        did anything unusual happened?

        141
        00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,870
        We're authorities looking for you

        142
        00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,120
        or they keep an eye
        on me all the time.

        143
        00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,340
        Because I live in

        144
        00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,130
        the bookkeeping and loaded with

        145
        00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,265
        the money that people are
        just keep watching me.

        146
        00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:21,185
        But every day I feel
        like a lot of pressure

        147
        00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,320
        that you felt that they might

        148
        00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,075
        eventually arrest you and

        149
        00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:28,385
        perhaps send you
        away or kill you?

        150
        00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:34,670
        Probably. Okay. Okay.
        So you had hired

        151
        00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,040
        someone to help you
        and your family

        152
        00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,050
        escape and then this

        153
        00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,375
        time you were successful
        in crossing the border?

        154
        00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,880
        Yeah. Ok. And then

        155
        00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,115
        where did you go after
        you cross the border?

        156
        00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:51,740
        I stay in that

        157
        00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,575
        they call ME that's as
        close to the border.

        158
        00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,380
        Stayed there about three months.

        159
        00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,940
        And I don't have
        money to go again

        160
        00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,160
        to carried out camp because
        they need to walk about.

        161
        00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,245
        Alma, RNA tried to get away
        from the Thai soldier from

        162
        00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:20,045
        the robbery, dropped that.

        163
        00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:22,220
        You don't know how to get there.

        164
        00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,270
        You will be wrapped by or assault

        165
        00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,515
        by the Thai people or by
        the soul allowed the bada.

        166
        00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:36,020
        Okay. So then did

        167
        00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,090
        you eventually end up
        in carrier and and

        168
        00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,550
        I I reached carried down.

        169
        00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:48,170
        That's l2. Care.
        With your family?

        170
        00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,600
        Yeah. Okay. All of you together?

        171
        00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,525
        Okay. How long were
        you and carried on?

        172
        00:10:56,525 --> 00:11:07,310
        I stay and carried out
        until December 1983.

        173
        00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:17,620
        Okay. Okay. What did
        you do and carry down?

        174
        00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,740
        I start working because I feel

        175
        00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,230
        like I'm so depressed there.

        176
        00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,450
        Whenever they're there for a few,

        177
        00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,490
        we have nothing to do.

        178
        00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,960
        Really like it live in

        179
        00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,020
        the jail because to
        have a fun around,

        180
        00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,220
        you cannot walk anywhere.

        181
        00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,730
        And I start working with

        182
        00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,910
        the IRC, International
        Rescue Committee.

        183
        00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,540
        And what kind of work
        were you doing with them?

        184
        00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,930
        Doing the lab technician as

        185
        00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,275
        the blood bank and keep the blood

        186
        00:11:57,275 --> 00:12:01,550
        ordered blood for
        the hospital there.

        187
        00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,540
        And I have some background
        about that then

        188
        00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,940
        that time I cannot speak
        English very well.

        189
        00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,855
        So I just mixed with friends
        and English all the time.

        190
        00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,525
        And my friend over
        there teach me to

        191
        00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:21,330
        Howard and keep
        learning from them.

        192
        00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,710
        Did you go to any other
        camps after carried down,

        193
        00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,940
        where did you come directly

        194
        00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,710
        to the United States after that?

        195
        00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,830
        Now, I work with

        196
        00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,370
        the International Red
        Cross for a few months.

        197
        00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,800
        And then at that time I file

        198
        00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,220
        a petition to come
        to United State.

        199
        00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,780
        And later on I was
        a subnet to come.

        200
        00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,160
        And I went to work with the JV,

        201
        00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,675
        a detailed jar
        involuntary agency for

        202
        00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:02,390
        interpreting how people
        and 6AM until December 83.

        203
        00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,655
        They move my my summer,

        204
        00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:13,040
        my wife, to a processing
        cam and Sean Murray.

        205
        00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,140
        And that time, the GABA-A

        206
        00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,765
        won me to go back to work with
        them again and carry down.

        207
        00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:27,725
        And they asked me to and I say,

        208
        00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,600
        yes, decide to go back to work.

        209
        00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,035
        But my wife and John
        Murray came for awhile.

        210
        00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:36,545
        And after I've gone back to
        work for a few about man.

        211
        00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:39,260
        And they say that they

        212
        00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,750
        want my wife to go
        to Philippine to

        213
        00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,820
        learn English first and

        214
        00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,270
        leave me to work with
        them for six months.

        215
        00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,645
        And I have an
        algorithm with them.

        216
        00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,220
        I don't want to

        217
        00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,400
        separate that and my wife
        doesn't want to do that.

        218
        00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,060
        And then I break the
        contract. I didn't work.

        219
        00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,580
        So they sent me and my wife
        to know cam in Indonesia,

        220

        until June 1984.

        223

        During statesman, I work
        with the United Nation.

        you doing for the UNHCR?

        226
        00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,245
        They asked me to help

        00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,480
        they were telling
        you or teaching you

        240
        00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,805
        about the United States and
        how things operate here,

        241
        00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:25,010
        is that when you have a class

        242
        00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,710
        teaching three months for people,

        243
        00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,055
        but I don't have a chance to
        learn all of that because

        244
        00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,280
        they say that I can speak
        English, I can understand.

        245
        00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,240
        So they asked me to
        work to help them.

        246
        00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,945
        But eventually I got a
        job with the UN ACR.

        247
        00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:47,195
        So they kind of go to the
        class on a one hour a day.

        248
        00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:50,190
        And beside that, I
        just go to work.

        249
        00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,180
        Okay. Did you fly directly to

        250
        00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,190
        Minnesota when you
        left Singapore?

        251
        00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,190
        Yes. Okay. And did you
        come to the twin cities

        252
        00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,130
        or Rochester or where did that I

        253
        00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,375
        can then seti because my
        mother-in-law came here first.

        254
        00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:15,530
        Okay. And so did you move
        in with your mother-in-law?

        255
        00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,780
        Yeah. Okay. So what once
        you relocated here,

        256
        00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,120
        what what did what
        were you doing?

        257
        00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,590
        Were you taking classes or did

        258
        00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,750
        they have you start working?

        259
        00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,800
        The lowdown?

        260
        00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,245
        So say this is my sponsor.

        261
        00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:37,085
        And when I came,

        262
        00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:42,560
        he has asked me to what job,

        263
        00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,310
        part time job that I want
        to do, something like that.

        264
        00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:52,760
        And they as I want
        to go to school,

        265
        00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,855
        but I have no money, nothing.

        266
        00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:59,840
        My sponsor, one meter,

        267
        00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,240
        you will find a job.

        268
        00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,650
        Because they said I
        can able to work.

        269
        00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,690
        And about three weeks
        after I sell in

        270
        00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,900
        Minnesota and I got a job

        00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,580

        service and got

        273
        00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,255

        for about two months.

        274

        As the clerk, there's
        help filing paper

        the refugee that came.

        276
        00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,065
        And after that.

        277
        00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:40,130
        The job was run now has nothing
        to do and they get laid

        278
        00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,230
        off or stay home about one way.

        279
        00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,350
        And then the community,

        280
        00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,010
        Cambodian community in Twin City,

        281
        00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,925
        they need some body
        that able to were.

        282
        00:17:55,925 --> 00:18:00,655
        And the,

        283
        00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,770
        I know one of my teachers as

        284
        00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,680
        the board member,
        the urbanization.

        285
        00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,180
        And the he asked me
        to go to work there.

        286
        00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,070
        And they offer me

        287
        00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:18,110
        a job full-time job at
        the director of a MA.

        288
        00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,715
        So I started that job
        from September 84

        289
        00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:31,225
        until October edify occur
        because of a lot of pressure.

        290
        00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:33,880
        And the job is so
        hard for me to do

        291
        00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,390
        it because I'm new
        in this country.

        292
        00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,550
        I didn't know how to read fun.

        293
        00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,870
        I didn't know how to looking

        294
        00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,155
        for fun to support the program.

        295
        00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:48,365
        Finally, I decide to quit.

        296
        00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:53,330
        Before I quit, I'm lucky
        that I got another job.

        297
        00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,770
        So the Ramsey County

        298
        00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,780
        because I'm working
        with them before.

        299
        00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,960
        So they they know
        only that asked me

        300
        00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,090
        too because I said I

        301
        00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,565
        don't want to end up
        placing it anymore.

        302
        00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,865
        And then they say
        you can apply job in

        303
        00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:09,680
        Ramsey County and then I apply

        304
        00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,840
        I got that job and
        but I'm here now.

        305
        00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,060
        Ok. And you're with
        Ramsey County now?

        306
        00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,805
        Yes. What is the what
        kind of a job isn't

        307
        00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,820
        the first job that I got as

        308
        00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,615
        an interpreter to help
        people in Ramsey County.

        309
        00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:27,425
        That about three years later,

        310
        00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:30,530
        the county of tests

        311
        00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,980
        that I can take a test to
        become a financial look.

        312
        00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,690
        And then I pass at
        that time in 1989.

        313
        00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,880
        So I have become a
        financial it then

        314
        00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,725
        Ramsey County, OK. Now,

        315
        00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:47,045
        are you working with solely
        with Cambodians and other

        316
        00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,880
        Asians or are you working with

        317
        00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,045
        a wide variety of
        groups of my job now?

        318
        00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:57,200
        Yep. No, I'm working but
        the American client.

        319
        00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,090
        I'm not every fuji,

        320
        00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,350
        so no work at all.

        321
        00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:07,820
        Okay. No. I preferred that
        American because I know

        322
        00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,545
        too many people in
        the community and

        323
        00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,690
        I don't want to
        involve that because

        324
        00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,975
        of the confidential Sure.

        325
        00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:21,065
        And the problem with
        communication or whatever.

        326
        00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,940
        So I write a little bit.

        327
        00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,775
        When they put me in
        the job, they asked,

        328
        00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,950
        I didn't have a chance
        to choose that,

        329
        00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,960
        but they couldn't live up
        at their mark on clients,

        330
        00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,010
        so I decided to stay.

        331
        00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,180
        I didn't bow to let

        332
        00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:41,930
        each unit would or

        333
        00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,120
        are there things that
        that concern you

        334
        00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,365
        or or problems that that you are.

        335
        00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:51,350
        Face having been in
        the United States,

        336
        00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,480
        particularly Minnesota
        for the past few years.

        337
        00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,120
        Are there are there are
        issues that that concern

        338
        00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,380
        you are or you do think

        339
        00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,120
        about it a fair
        amount in terms of,

        340
        00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,565
        of your transition into

        341
        00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,290
        US society and also

        342
        00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,630
        perhaps fellow Cambodians
        sort of moved here.

        343
        00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,630
        Are there any kinds of
        things that trouble you?

        344
        00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,640
        My concern is for
        Cambodian people,

        345
        00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,375
        especially the family without

        346
        00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:21,350
        a single family, single pattern.

        347
        00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:27,200
        And also that moat
        pendant and household.

        348
        00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,774
        Most of Cambodian that came
        to United State during ARE.

        349
        00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:38,460
        So now most of them,

        350
        00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:47,465
        they don't have a lot our
        education background,

        351
        00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:50,105
        and most of them farmer

        352
        00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:54,230
        or a citizen that
        live in the city,

        353
        00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,920
        but they did not have
        a good background

        354
        00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:05,300
        about the skill that
        fit in this society.

        355
        00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,980
        And they have a lot of
        problem to adjusted.

        356
        00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,905
        But for myself that I can speak,

        357
        00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:16,100
        I cannot just faster than them.

        358
        00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,080
        And the people that they know
        nothing about the language,

        359
        00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,610
        they tend to be really
        hard to adjust them.

        360
        00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,970
        And the family that

        361
        00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,030
        some people that cannot read
        or write their own language,

        362
        00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,080
        as it's rarely frosted
        them for them to learn

        363
        00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,210
        the other Langley because

        364
        00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,535
        they all know they don't
        know how to read and write.

        365
        00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:45,620
        They know how to
        speed communication,

        366
        00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,390
        but for reading and writing,

        367
        00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,990
        it's really hard and
        it made them more

        368
        00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,580
        harder than anybody
        that can speak, read,

        369
        00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,860
        and write their
        own name and says,

        370
        00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,330
        my concern is that

        371
        00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,290
        those people are really
        hard to adjust to this,

        372
        00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,540
        this society and that the state.

        373
        00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,030
        They gobble men and this

        374
        00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,430
        they should understand
        and it should help them.

        375
        00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,550
        Do you think, what do you
        think would be the best,

        376
        00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,100
        best approach to that education?

        377
        00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,080
        Or what do you

        378
        00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,730
        think would work in terms

        379
        00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,625
        of perhaps helping
        them adjust better?

        380
        00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,294
        They need a lot of support.

        381
        00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:38,284
        Especially the families support,

        382
        00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:42,830
        because they used to live in

        383
        00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,740
        the the period of time

        384
        00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,835
        that have a lot of
        crisis that need to Y.

        385
        00:23:49,835 --> 00:23:53,870
        And also that they
        have a horrible time.

        386
        00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,800
        That they never, they
        cannot forget about that.

        387
        00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
        Because of the the life

        388
        00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,025
        that they have gone through
        during the tomorrows,

        389
        00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:11,360
        make them some people
        that almost lost memory.

        390
        00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,420
        They become so much The Press.

        391
        00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,900
        But they don't know
        how to speak out.

        392
        00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,755
        They don't know how
        to tell the ADA and

        393
        00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:30,155
        our culture people nothing
        one to share their problem,

        394
        00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:35,930
        to be either unless they trust
        Azariah, close relative.

        395
        00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,695
        If you are working,
        tried to help them.

        396
        00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,925
        If they don't know you,

        397
        00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:42,920
        they don't want to
        share any idea or

        398
        00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,095
        they don't want to share
        any problem with you.

        399
        00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,015
        So you cannot help them.

        400
        00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:49,820
        But if they understand
        the culture,

        401
        00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,410
        they understand a problem,

        402
        00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,240
        trying to help them.

        403
        00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,750
        Sometime people offer the
        problem so we can help them.

        404
        00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,900
        And the other thing

        405
        00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,945
        right now is that the
        kid growing up here,

        406
        00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:15,815
        they'd learn the lay at
        faster than the parent.

        407
        00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:20,060
        And then to have a
        different point of view,

        408
        00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,480
        some care did grow up in
        the cam when he came here.

        409
        00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,840
        They don't know about the
        Cambodia culture at all.

        410
        00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,295
        And then the chi
        Laika have a problem

        411
        00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:36,770
        between parents and children
        and between because the kid,

        412
        00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,990
        when they live in home,

        413
        00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,490
        depend on one num to be

        414
        00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,735
        Cambodian to discipline them
        the way that they work.

        415
        00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:46,160
        Well when they go to school,

        416
        00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,115
        they have another law
        that they must follow.

        417
        00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:52,220
        There must obey
        that, this society.

        418
        00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,515
        And then when they go back
        to school, Chi legged,

        419
        00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:58,235
        two different society for
        them that it's hard to her.

        420
        00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,990
        So it essay, we need to have

        421
        00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,900
        some people that understand
        a problem tried to

        422
        00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,040
        help him to adjusted by
        offering my education

        423
        00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,465
        to them or some kind acre
        or training to them,

        424
        00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:15,140
        trying to know made them
        and wild with the society,

        425
        00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,720
        become a productive citizen.

        426
        00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,870
        How do you feel that,

        427
        00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,420
        that you've worked on a lot of

        428
        00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,160
        the in terms of what you
        went through in Cambodia,

        429
        00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,710
        Do you feel that you've
        had opportunities to,

        430
        00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,480
        to address that the,

        431
        00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,465
        the experience and work
        through all of that yourself.

        432
        00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,925
        You feel like you. I think so.

        433
        00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:45,610
        Because when you go to you
        can see a lot of thing.

        434
        00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,495
        Most of I feel that I

        435
        00:26:49,495 --> 00:26:52,840
        know a lot of thing
        in this country,

        436
        00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,480
        mod and I knew in my hand.

        437
        00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,735
        And tell me late
        the government or

        438
        00:26:58,735 --> 00:27:04,325
        the system how to
        process in this society.

        439
        00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:06,710
        Because when I was in Cambodia,

        440
        00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,990
        I didn't know about the Congress.

        441
        00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,285
        How many Congress
        in Cambodia Hub,

        442
        00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:12,940
        how the legislature work,

        443
        00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,540
        something like that because in

        444
        00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,805
        school they never
        teach you to learn.

        445
        00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:22,295
        They just gave you all these
        samurai general literature,

        446
        00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:25,805
        little bit math, a little
        bit, some like that.

        447
        00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:30,140
        Unless you get into
        the university,

        448
        00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,630
        you trying to be a doctor
        or a professor or whatever.

        449
        00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,740
        And then you can know

        450
        00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,320
        only the brand that
        you go and needs.

        451
        00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,985
        No general knowledge
        like this society.

        452
        00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:49,400
        So is people like myself
        that want to learn more,

        453
        00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,734
        want to have a better
        understanding.

        454
        00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:56,990
        English can communicate
        with the people here.

        455
        00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,050
        So we have a better chance to

        456
        00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,230
        adjust to live in this society.

        457
        00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,730
        So people that I think the
        problem is the communication.

        458
        00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,680
        If the people can
        learn the language

        459
        00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,290
        faster so they can adjust
        whatever they won.

        460
        00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:19,230
        Okay. Stu law. No, no, no, no.

        00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,560
        Okay, my final question is,

        2
        00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,870
        in view of, of what
        you experienced in

        3
        00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,735
        Cambodia when the Khmer
        Rouge were in power.

        4
        00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:29,800
        How have you dealt with the,

        5
        00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,075
        the nightmare that
        you went through?

        6
        00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,495
        What kind of coping mechanisms
        have you developed?

        7
        00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:39,450
        How have you worked out
        all of those issues?

        8
        00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,075
        Until right now?

        9
        00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:51,530
        When I think about

        10
        00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,385
        the when the tie and
        doing the command,

        11
        00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:58,700
        I still have a bad dream.

        12
        00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,215
        Usually if the hot and
        so tired during the day.

        13
        00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:08,135
        And you go to sleep.

        14
        00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,055
        Alvin dream about
        during the time.

        15
        00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:16,960
        Sometime I saw blade to Meroe,

        16
        00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,020
        are the people with
        the leader to come

        17
        00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,785
        out or the shoulder that
        trying to catch me,

        18
        00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,750
        wanted to kill me something.

        19
        00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,570
        And after terrible
        nightmare light

        20
        00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,110
        that just woke up in
        the middle of May and

        21
        00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,905
        I couldn't sleep at
        R. So out of my mind,

        22
        00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:46,405
        you're thinking I start to
        trying to suppress them down,

        23
        00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:48,520
        tried to forget about that.

        24
        00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,495
        Trying to think about the
        future instead of the path.

        25
        00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:56,870
        And I don't want to Aldo dream.

        26
        00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,785
        Come back again in my mind.

        27
        00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,829
        This is just trying to think
        everything in the future.

        28
        00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,690
        What most of the
        time when they have

        29
        00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,930
        that dream late that
        icon sleep RNA.

        30
        00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:14,560
        And trying to take like a
        medicine to may get headache,

        31
        00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,930
        take medicine so they can sleep.

        32
        00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,800
        And especially I try to work,

        33
        00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,400
        but this is just only myself that

        34
        00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,929
        I know that I can forget
        all those thing easily.

        35
        00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:36,095
        Because solver, working the data,

        36
        00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,375
        people have a lot of friend,

        37
        00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,990
        tough about the future toddler
        by something else that

        38
        00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:48,530
        fun because I can easy
        to forget our dosing.

        39
        00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,970
        But if it comes up to

        40
        00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,680
        my mind that take
        at least 24 hours,

        41
        00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,475
        something like that, this
        wondering around those thing.

        42
        00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:02,285
        And I know you've got a problem.

        43
        00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,385
        Just walk away.

        44
        00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,650
        Take all, go somewhere.

        45
        00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,390
        Our tile with a friend,
        different subject.

        46
        00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,190
        Try to forget that.

        47
        00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,550
        Sometime like have an
        American friend asking

        48
        00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,950
        about AS topping a little bit

        49
        00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,080
        and then one day
        chained to the Odyssey.

        50
        00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,770
        Well, do you have
        anything else that you'd

        51

        That'll college
        and seminary today

        2
        00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,470
        come with me through
        these gates to

        3
        00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,780
        a beautiful all new canvas,

        4
        00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,760
        indeed a proper setting for

        5
        00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,080
        the Christian liberal arts

        6
        00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,090
        and conservative
        theological education.

        7
        00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,145
        Looking at our campus
        from the Southeast,

        8
        00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:30,460
        we see the college and seminary
        located in the beautiful,

        9
        00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,340
        rolling wooded hills
        beside lake Valentine.

        10
        00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,750
        This is just five miles
        north of our old campus.

        11
        00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,015
        Here the emphasis is on
        the seminary complex

        12
        00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:46,320
        campus, as it appears
        from the west.

        13
        00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,740
        This area will someday be

        14
        00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,200
        occupied by the
        administration building.

        15
        00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,280
        Bethel probably boasts one of

        16
        00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,270
        the most beautiful campus
        settings in the country.

        17
        00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,000
        Each of the college
        buildings is connected with

        18
        00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,805
        the other building by a
        weatherproof walkway,

        19
        00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:06,875
        both above and below ground.

        20
        00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,840
        Hi, I'm sure you will
        agree if you walk

        21
        00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,060
        between the buildings
        on the Old Campus,

        22
        00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,210
        this indeed is a worthy edition.

        23
        00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,400
        We look at the campus now from

        24
        00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,105
        the east with the new
        townhouses and view.

        25
        00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:22,550
        This is the field of conflict for

        26
        00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,190
        football, baseball, and soccer

        27
        00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,595
        athletics out
        important at Bethel.

        28
        00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:31,100
        Our new dorms consist of

        29
        00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,725
        14 units and two
        clusters of seven.

        30
        00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:37,580
        We can house 2221 unit 234,

        31
        00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,210
        and the other a total of 456.

        32
        00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,760
        And they are all filled with

        33
        00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,940
        the housing on the Old
        Campus filled as well.

        34
        00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,570
        Each apartment
        contains six students.

        35
        00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,960
        There is a health center and
        recreation room available in

        36
        00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,500
        this complex and all the
        other complexes as well.

        37
        00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,320
        The total enrollment in
        this year will run between

        38
        00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,575
        12851300 in the college in
        about 240 in the seminary.

        39
        00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:09,110
        This was the first dormitory to

        40
        00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,060
        have been constructed
        on the new campus.

        41
        00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,000
        It holds 120 students.

        42
        00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,430
        Here's located one of

        43
        00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,595
        the most up-to-date libraries
        in the state of Minnesota.

        44
        00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,980
        It is on two levels.

        45
        00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,260
        Individual study units provide

        46

        48
        00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,420
        which will be difficult
        to accomplish.

        49
        00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,489
        In the main library,

        Baseball brings honour
        to AJ alma mater.

        119
        00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,740
        Now soccer has been

        120
        00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,085
        successfully added to
        the velocity program.

        121
        00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:13,160
        Our lovely young
        ladies are in hand for

        122
        00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,930
        all major events to encourage

        123
        00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,790
        both participants and spectators.

        124
        00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,950
        A most important part
        of the Bethel story is

        125
        00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,480
        the contribution of the seminary

        126
        00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,295
        to the Baptist
        general conference,

        127
        00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,835
        as well as to all major
        evangelical groups.

        128
        00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,710
        Since its inception,

        129
        00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,840
        theological studies
        at Bethel seminary

        130
        00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,370
        had been set within the framework

        131
        00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,230
        of historic evangelical theology.

        132
        00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,010
        Particular emphasis has been

        133
        00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,020
        placed upon a
        theology which gives

        134
        00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,505
        primacy to the Bible as the
        source of Christian doctrine.

        135
        00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:51,890
        Major attention has been given to

        136
        00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,875
        the foundational truths
        of evangelical theology,

        137
        00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,515
        such as the reliability
        of the scriptures,

        138
        00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:59,195
        THE gravity of man,

        139
        00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,565
        the necessity of
        divine redemption,

        140
        00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,590
        personal regeneration,

        141
        00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,525
        the resurrection of believers,

        142
        00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,460
        and the imminent
        visible return of

        143
        00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,230
        Jesus Christ, our Lord.

        144
        00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,930
        And say, Dr. Gordon Johnson

        145
        00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,090
        announced this year
        that Bethel graduated

        146
        00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,910
        55 seniors and is currently

        147
        00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,990
        enrolling between

        148
        00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,240
        two hundred and forty and two
        hundred and fifty students.

        149
        00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,775
        Bethel is far more
        than its buildings.

        150
        00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:29,705
        Bethel is more than superior
        academic achievement.

        151
        00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:33,350
        Bethel is even bigger than
        the all important graduation

        152
        00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,950
        on Bethel is bigger than
        any personal achievement.

        153
        00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,930
        As important as it is,

        154
        00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,799
        Bethel is a corporate
        opportunity to grow with others

        155
        00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,080
        >> in spiritual
        outreach and develop.

        156
        00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,315
        Although chapel is not
        required at Bethel,

        157
        00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,030
        it is most significant
        that most of

        158
        00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,610
        the student body unites
        each day for worship.

        159
        00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,690
        Time to time, the
        entire student body,

        160
        00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,920
        both seminary in college,

        161
        00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,950
        meet outdoors in a great
        natural ampitheater.

        162
        00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,260
        Jerry Healy shares with
        us student testimonies.

        163
        00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,790
        Now from our campus

        164
        00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,010
        is a Christian

        165
        00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,815
        arts colleague, James
        Theological Seminary

        166
        00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:34,745
        dedicated to the development
        of a strong people,

        167
        00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:39,260
        fully matures, sensitive,
        and inner directed.

        168
        00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,885
        A people continually growing

        169
        00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,185
        toward the model of Jesus Christ.

        170
        00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:49,070
        I've only been at Beth
        and I think the thing

        171
        00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,610
        that impresses me the most
        was the Christian community.

        172
        00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,360
        Yes, I think it's so
        important to integrate

        173
        00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,290
        academic and special thanks

        174
        00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,255
        to the thing I most crazy about,

        175
        00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,520
        about FAFSA is that

        176
        00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,935
        it's been sorry about
        the whole person.

        177
        00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:14,195
        Academic or intellectual
        or spiritual Sosa.

        178
        00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,590
        But watching such that I can have

        179
        00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,165
        a relationship between faculty.

        180
        00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,495
        Ostinato festivals are really

        181
        00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,395
        sincere and they really
        want to be loved.

        182
        00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:27,785
        People town opening my mind

        183
        00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:31,940
        to expand on almost any
        broad thing that I want to.

        184
        00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,365
        Education I'm getting
        here is type.

        185
        00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,990
        And that I think has

        186
        00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,450
        prepared me for the
        direction I'm going.

        187
        00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,585
        I think it's given us a
        quality education advisor,

        188
        00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,280
        confidence learning,

        189
        00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,990
        part of that community
        experience I

        190
        00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,670
        see as it's trying to find

        191
        00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,500
        a way to relate
        what we're learning

        192
        00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,360
        in our classes to our
        Christian experience.

        193
        00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,265
        >> But what about Bethel?

        194
        00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,625
        In a day when colleges are
        closing all over the nation,

        195
        00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,820
        when enrollments are
        falling off at seminaries.

        196
        00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,640
        What about Bethel, Dr. Lundquist?

        197
        00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,800
        I have just begun my 20th year as

        198
        00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,320
        president of Bethel
        College in seminary.

        199
        00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,780
        And I want to say that
        from the perspective

        200
        00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,690
        of almost two decades
        in this office,

        201
        00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,790
        that the work of
        leading our college

        202
        00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,770
        and our Seminary
        has never been more

        203
        00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,335
        exciting or more satisfying

        204
        00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:30,635
        or more challenging
        than it is this year.

        205
        00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,300
        I'm so glad that when

        206
        00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,610
        the Lord called me
        into his service,

        207
        00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,690
        sign me to the task of
        working with young people.

        208
        00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,610
        And I have a sense of

        209
        00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,120
        great personal satisfaction
        in seeking to relate

        210
        00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,270
        my own life and
        commitment to Christ to

        211
        00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,010
        the hundreds of
        young people who are

        212
        00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,260
        on the campus year after year,

        213
        00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,130
        and pray that as they
        find their place in life,

        214
        00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,980
        God will use them to help shape

        215
        00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,775
        the future of our world
        with Christian values.

        216
        00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:04,550
        During the course of the
        two decades that I've

        217
        00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,160
        had the privilege of being
        on the Bethel campus,

        218
        00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,300
        I would guess that I have had
        the opportunity of working

        219
        00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,730
        directly or indirectly with

        220
        00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,970
        more than 15 thousand
        young people.

        221
        00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,325
        And wherever I go
        around the world,

        222
        00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,055
        I see them busy for Jesus Christ.

        223
        00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,950
        They are in almost every
        field of endeavor.

        224
        00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,884
        Some are college president's,

        225
        00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,360
        some are presence of
        Christian schools like

        226
        00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,895
        Bethel College and a seminary.

        227
        00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,475
        Some are teachers in
        public universities,

        228
        00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:38,105
        some are doctors and
        lawyers and businessmen.

        229
        00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,730
        Many are social workers and are

        230
        00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,300
        extending their lives into
        this field of human endeavor.

        231
        00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,970
        Many are missionaries
        and pastors on

        232
        00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,765
        the front line proclaiming
        the gospel of Jesus Christ.

        233
        00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,670
        I always come back from seeing

        234
        00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,320
        these alumni at work around

        235
        00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,430
        the world praising God all
        over again for the share that

        236
        00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,090
        Mrs. Lundquist and I
        have in their lives.

        237
        00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,850
        Just the other day, I
        received a note from

        238
        00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,445
        a young girl who
        graduated last spring.

        239
        00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,870
        He's now the director of

        240
        00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,480
        a Bible school program
        on the west coast.

        241
        00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,090
        She wrote saying that during
        the preceding summer,

        242
        00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,140
        she had the chance of

        243
        00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,910
        leading 71 children to

        244
        00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,265
        a saving knowledge
        of Jesus Christ.

        245
        00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,780
        So she was writing out a great
        enthusiasm along with it.

        246
        00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,910
        This young girl just
        a few months out of

        247
        00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,870
        Bethel and closed a
        money order for $40,

        248
        00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,130
        her first gift as an
        alumna to her alma mater.

        249
        00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,875
        With it, she said a little note,

        250
        00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,595
        you might be interested
        in one paragraph of it.

        251
        00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:42,395
        This young girl wrote,

        252
        00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,200
        I graduated from
        Bethel this past May,

        253
        00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,970
        and I never told you how much.

        254
        00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,710
        I appreciate both of you.

        255
        00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,050
        This is addressed to
        both Mrs. Lundquist,

        256
        00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,210
        myself, you were and

        257
        00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,565
        have continued to be
        an inspiration to me.

        258
        00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,320
        I pray that God will richly

        259
        00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,495
        bless you both for
        all you've done.

        260
        00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:00,935
        Not just for battle,

        261
        00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,965
        but for me and all the
        individual students.

        262
        00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,705
        We love you dearly.

        263
        00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:07,520
        And I want you to
        know that I will be

        264
        00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,040
        continually praying for you both.

        265
        00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,200
        Well, that's enough to keep

        266
        00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,510
        a president going for
        another whole year.

        267
        00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,600
        And it's only a small sample of

        268
        00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
        the enthusiasm of one
        alumnus that i c,

        269
        00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,480
        multiplied and many
        lives around the world,

        270
        00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,605
        and that I share myself long ago,

        271
        00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:30,560
        Mark Hopkins said that
        the ideal picture of

        272
        00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,370
        a school was made up of one
        student and one teacher,

        273
        00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,665
        each on two ends of a log.

        274
        00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,300
        And when they were there,

        275
        00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,120
        they had an educational
        experience going.

        276
        00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,400
        I think, however that
        we would have to

        277
        00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,500
        say that somewhere
        on that log there is

        278
        00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,755
        a third person and
        that's the partner

        279
        00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,535
        like you in the life
        of Bethel people.

        280
        00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:54,620
        And we believe in the
        mission of our school,

        281
        00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,720
        who believe in
        young people today,

        282
        00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,080
        who believe in the need for
        Christian higher education,

        283
        00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,060
        who believe in using education

        284
        00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,370
        as an instrument of the gospel.

        285
        00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,340
        And who, as a result
        of these beliefs,

        286
        00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,925
        are investing their
        gifts in battle.

        287
        00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:15,110
        I feel that you are partners
        with us in helping to shape

        288
        00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,930
        a whole new generation that can

        289
        00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,305
        make a difference for Jesus
        Christ in this world.

        290
        00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:23,840
        I hope that you will
        want to continue to

        291
        00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,225
        be a partner at the
        level of stewardship.

        292
        00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,410
        And that this year you
        will again find great joy

        293
        00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,804
        and satisfaction yourself
        in multiplying your life

        294
        00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:38,060
        >> into the lives of
        hundreds of young people

        295
        00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,260
        whose education you
        make possible at Beso.

        296
        00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,620
        Thank you so much for what
        you do and for what you are.

        297
        00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,570
        God bless you richly.

        00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,525
        Sorry. Titled his talk.

        2
        00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,720
        I come just a few days ago from

        3
        00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,080
        the voltage Swedish Baptist
        Church in the world.

        4
        00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,940
        As you probably know,

        5
        00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,765
        there will be celebrating
        the 20th anniversary.

        6
        00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:24,959
        And as I say, the oldest
        in the world, they know,

        7
        00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,730
        Swedish Baptist Church
        in Sweden that says

        8
        00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,090
        oldest church down in Iowa.

        9
        00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,189
        The General Conference was

        10
        00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,740
        organized in that church.
        Now that's interesting.

        11
        00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,324
        You know that somebody in 1879,

        12
        00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:39,719
        Agenda conference organizer to

        13
        00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,595
        very small group of churches,

        14
        00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,330
        not so many from the East.

        15
        00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,799
        There were some churches
        there, of course,

        16
        00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,030
        but it is more in

        17
        00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,240
        the midway and some from
        the East met there.

        18
        00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,079
        And we have the history in

        19
        00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,729
        the General Conference
        and you'll that you

        20
        00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,905
        get every year at the conference.

        21
        00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,450
        You have some records there

        22
        00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,250
        until she was chairman

        23
        00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,685
        that year and so on,
        presiding officer.

        24
        00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:10,430
        And where they met
        two pizzas servant.

        25
        00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,489
        Well, the very first
        one would be that

        26
        00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:17,225
        one in Lansing pilot.

        27
        00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:20,089
        Now, regarding the Swedish
        Baptist movement manner,

        28
        00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:24,214
        say just talk in front of the
        Swedish Baptist movement.

        29
        00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:28,565
        >> America was like
        the Lutheran movement.

        30
        00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:32,045
        Unlike other movements
        from Europe.

        31
        00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:35,420
        They would come to America
        because that's a new country.

        32
        00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,949
        That so that's a silver

        33
        00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:38,840
        and gold and American,
        all of that.

        34
        00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,715
        My mother and father came.

        35
        00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,459
        Your some of your ancestors did,

        36
        00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,320
        Davis did and all that.

        37
        00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,725
        And sometimes they come
        in groups from Sweden.

        38
        00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:53,960
        And now my father and mother
        came first to New York.

        39
        00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,510
        Never met that there
        were married and he

        40
        00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,180
        became a Christian also,

        41
        00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,940
        but he wasn't at first
        and they went out west

        42
        00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,175
        and finally father homesteaders

        43
        00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,320
        to farm in northern Kansas.

        44
        00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,305
        Here. They weren't
        alone in that district.

        45
        00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:12,004
        There's a group that
        I come from Sweden,

        46
        00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:14,570
        had been converted in Sweden.

        47
        00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,430
        There's a book that
        I wish I could

        48
        00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,450
        read if you get a hold of it,

        49
        00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,605
        the song of the roche.

        50
        00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,669
        Maybe it's in the library,

        51
        00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,475
        maybe not iPads to run my church.

        52
        00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,140
        I send it to theater ambition of

        53
        00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,820
        the covenant church,
        a copy of it.

        54
        00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,180
        Sum those two takes care.

        55
        00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,449
        It presents the artistic
        movements are with God in

        56
        00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,490
        Sweden and they'd
        meet and you see

        57
        00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,910
        the state church
        was cold and day.

        58
        00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,109
        It was pretty much
        dead in places,

        59
        00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:42,875
        you know, and it didn't,
        it wasn't spirits.

        60
        00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,095
        Or even Sir Walter
        Scott brings that out.

        61
        00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:48,905
        How the power let that cathedral
        and went to the cottage.

        62
        00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:52,760
        Remember that line
        Spencer edition said?

        63
        00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,330
        And so they organized

        64
        00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,155
        their little church
        in northern Kansas.

        65
        00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:00,065
        Maybe 12 members,
        maybe 40 members.

        66
        00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:03,950
        Number of couples that
        knew each other in Sweden.

        67
        00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,589
        And there are at least I remember

        68
        00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:09,920
        was when I was in
        Sunday School there,

        69
        00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,980
        my father taught off him
        and and all the boys.

        70
        00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,050
        And I was five years old.

        71
        00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,745
        Cemetery moved away.

        72
        00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,770
        But he was my father
        was talking and he was

        73
        00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,090
        just a Ernest Christian and
        not educated and all of that,

        74
        00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,890
        but he knew the Bible.

        75
        00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,180
        I remember he turned to me.

        76
        00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,485
        Henry, what do you think about

        77
        00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,990
        that for Beth and thereby lab,

        78
        00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,960
        because he's got the
        humor to it to do that.

        79
        00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,315
        I think about that.

        80
        00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,145
        You're in this class too.

        81
        00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:38,900
        And there was a pastor.

        82
        00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,330
        His name was John JSON.
        Whatever the Misha DJ.

        83
        00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,549
        And they got you got $300 a year,

        84
        00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,430
        which is a lot of
        money things dollar

        85
        00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,609
        than would be dollar
        now would be 30,

        86
        00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,410
        $40? Yes, it would be.

        87
        00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,274
        I think you've you
        that well, anyway,

        88
        00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:58,040
        there were groups and
        there were churches here.

        89
        00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,580
        They're organized and then
        they would get together.

        90
        00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,455
        And finally they organized a
        general conference in 1879.

        91
        00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,655
        And then the work went up.

        92
        00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,755
        Now I press, there was no school.

        93
        00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:15,895
        You know that the preachers
        came from Sweden and

        94
        00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:17,710
        they want to keep a Swedish
        so long as they could

        95
        00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,860
        because they couldn't
        reach English very well.

        96
        00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,440
        And but then among them there was

        97
        00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,470
        one young man who was
        glories that converted.

        98
        00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,795
        His name was that
        lake. Sustained grin.

        99
        00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:31,180
        And he saw you felt deep in

        100
        00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,250
        his heart that he had
        great possibilities.

        101
        00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,210
        Otherwise, he saw
        the need of having

        102
        00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,919
        a training school for

        103
        00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,130
        Pasteur's training
        pastors for the work.

        104
        00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:50,189
        But he came as a sailor boy
        to America or something

        105
        00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,009
        in the Swedish young people,

        106
        00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,469
        Swedish boys all over the world,

        107
        00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:57,845
        I guess they see a
        ship, have saga.

        108
        00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,650
        That's sweet poem that
        everybody knows. Who should we?

        109
        00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,270
        I remember so well that I

        110
        00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,605
        think it's in there where it is.

        111
        00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,795
        But this young man was restless.

        112
        00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:10,565
        Maybe his name, his residency,

        113
        00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:12,049
        he didn't know what's
        the matter with

        114
        00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:14,330
        him and he didn't know
        what the recipe would be.

        115
        00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,829
        Left would help. And then he saw

        116
        00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:19,820
        a ship in the harbor.
        That's the answer.

        117
        00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,340
        And he made a run
        for the shipment,

        118
        00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,339
        got on there and actually
        kept and it could

        119
        00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,050
        be on there and stay on and

        120
        00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,105
        have a job and you
        save the seeds.

        121
        00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:31,025
        Now that's your Lexus.

        122
        00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,450
        It when we're talking
        about elections.

        123
        00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,325
        Abraham, marvelous person.

        124
        00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:37,519
        And he didn't go through
        just that experience,

        125
        00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,295
        but you wanted to go sailing

        126
        00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:42,635
        and there was a ship there too.

        127
        00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,195
        And he asked his parents,

        128
        00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,800
        got permission from
        them and they said,

        129
        00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,629
        well, if that is what
        you really want to do,

        130
        00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,070
        we're not going to stop you.

        131
        00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,690
        Pray that the Nordau
        bless you wherever

        132
        00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,505
        you go and take care of you.

        133
        00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:55,459
        And so alexis Adrian became

        134
        00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:01,379
        ish sailor boy and he's
        sale almost seven C's

        135
        00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,250
        the age of 15, I
        think this was now,

        136
        00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,330
        I like to think of it like say,

        137
        00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,790
        ugliness, going
        through three fires.

        138
        00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,865
        One wish a fire when
        you wish converted.

        139
        00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,950
        Another which a fire of

        140
        00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,635
        the Civil War in which
        you had a great time.

        141
        00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:22,700
        And the third was that
        fire when Chicago Bern,

        142
        00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,390
        almost Chicago altogether burned.

        143
        00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,560
        But the first fire was this one.

        144
        00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,150
        He wasn't a Christian.

        145
        00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,010
        He hadn't accepted
        crashes or saver.

        146
        00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,454
        He was living in what
        we would call sin,

        147
        00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:40,100
        and he was in New
        York Harbor sleeping.

        148
        00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,654
        In his book, on the
        ship in New York Harbor

        149
        00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:48,005
        >> And he had a dream.

        150
        00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,759
        In the dream you
        used on the way to

        151
        00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,289
        some place of amusement,

        152
        00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,810
        which was clearly considered sin.

        153
        00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,660
        And he saw a fire come,

        154
        00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,665
        come crawling along
        toward a from the right.

        155
        00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:02,570
        And the lack of it, prayer fire,

        156
        00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,994
        but it's a mystic fire.

        157
        00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,840
        >> And he saw it coming.

        158
        00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,250
        And he tried his
        best to get out of

        159
        00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,919
        the way and but he just

        160
        00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,484
        couldn't even outage
        a nightmarish hadron

        161
        00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,150
        just could move others.

        162
        00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,250
        It's coming, it's
        coming, it's coming.

        163
        00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,409
        And finally he was able just it,

        164
        00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:21,245
        it came and just got him
        in the side like that.

        165
        00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:27,680
        And he leaped up and it was
        so real and he was awake now,

        166
        00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,145
        but he jumped up and he
        bares his side to see.

        167
        00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:33,514
        It is still burning. It
        was still hot, Jesse,

        168
        00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:36,560
        and he couldn't see any
        sign of it on the body.

        169
        00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,515
        But something deeper
        that had happened.

        170
        00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:42,830
        And you read ran out on the
        deck and the snowstorm.

        171
        00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,509
        You've heard of John

        172
        00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,570
        the side kick, John Wesley John.

        173
        00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,430
        He was a slave driver.

        174
        00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,950
        John Newton, he was converted,

        175
        00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,839
        I believe in a
        snowstorm on he was,

        176
        00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,329
        he was just a simple
        sitting saver,

        177
        00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,259
        sinner saved and he would say in,

        178
        00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,390
        in a snowstorm, or
        the NYC, the ship.

        179
        00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,910
        Well now Edwin, which a

        180
        00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,280
        Christian and he was
        a warm Christian.

        181
        00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,140
        When he came back
        home, he had preached

        182
        00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,780
        and against a lot of page.

        183
        00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,279
        And they send an officer to

        184
        00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,080
        check up on what that
        young fellow is doing.

        185
        00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,825
        He's drawing people to
        homes and preaching.

        186
        00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,494
        But he listened. He
        couldn't finding

        187
        00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:24,710
        the matter that memo saying so.

        188
        00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,639
        Well, anyway, the Civil
        War broke out and

        189
        00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,480
        he joined the Navy and he was

        190
        00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,155
        soon became commander a
        battleships or warships.

        191
        00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,760
        Was it three or five that

        192
        00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,455
        He had commanded? Different ones.

        193
        00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:42,184
        You've all you, all of you
        have heard of monitor,

        194
        00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,580
        monitor the Civil War.

        195
        00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,345
        The I and the Swedish
        Jbuilder architect

        196
        00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,535
        constructed it into
        something new.

        197
        00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,739
        And do you remember the
        name of the southern ship

        198
        00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,840
        that was coming along so strong?

        199
        00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,370
        I was trying to think of it today

        200
        00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,540
        with our mirror and
        macro micro array.

        201
        00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,330
        And the North had nothing
        to meet that with.

        202
        00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,710
        You know, here comes out to

        203
        00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,840
        the DOM monitors
        sailing along there.

        204
        00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,820
        I saw the picture of
        it just yesterday.

        205
        00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,310
        I mean, I looked it
        up and I'm done.

        206
        00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,800
        Well, it was on that
        that'll monitor.

        207
        00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,690
        He didn't command, but he
        was on it at the time of

        208
        00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,585
        the battle and somebody
        else commanded it.

        209
        00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:22,460
        And that bigger ship
        fire, fired and hired.

        210
        00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,900
        And I don't know how much it hit,

        211
        00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,240
        but it is clenched off
        of the iron there.

        212
        00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,890
        And the commander of the

        213
        00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,395
        monetary came right back,
        and it came right back.

        214
        00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:33,064
        And the Merrimack
        didn't stay very long,

        215
        00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:35,555
        decided we'd better
        get out of here.

        216
        00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,249
        Well, I'm telling
        you that to show

        217
        00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:41,315
        that it was right in
        the middle of things.

        218
        00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,315
        And he commanded
        several battleships.

        219
        00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,999
        But, you know, there's
        something deep in his heart

        220
        00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:50,060
        that was more interesting
        than the Navy.

        221
        00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,265
        Or whenever the
        accretion that way.

        222
        00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,860
        So he went to the high
        commander commoner,

        223
        00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,575
        whoever that top was, an resign.

        224
        00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,510
        And you said you're
        fooling shade, can you?

        225
        00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,999
        Foolish? You've got
        everything that it

        226
        00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,150
        takes to be a commander
        battleship than the Navy,

        227
        00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,505
        you'll become a common
        or do you know that?

        228
        00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,350
        Yes. That may be
        true, that atrium,

        229
        00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,954
        but I have a higher calling

        230
        00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:12,830
        something higher fire descended,

        231
        00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,130
        as we say somewhat
        poetically. And he resign.

        232
        00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,760
        And then increasingly he felt

        233
        00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
        the need should be a training.

        234
        00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,055
        Swedish pastures came
        from Sweden to America.

        235
        00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,810
        And as long as
        everything was Swedish,

        236
        00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,445
        they got along pretty good.

        237
        00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,500
        But it became worse and

        238
        00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,685
        worse and some of them
        didn't have much training.

        239
        00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:37,235
        So there was a decision
        under God to start

        240
        00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:41,190
        a Swedish Baptist
        seminary in Chicago.

        241
        00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,540
        And you've heard many times,

        242
        00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,980
        I suppose at Founders Week,

        243
        00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,679
        that he started with one student,

        244
        00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,725
        and that student was silly.

        245
        00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,690
        And at Founders Week that night,

        246
        00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,160
        and there was a dedication

        247
        00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,290
        that was a Canvas symbol
        of the history of

        248
        00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,050
        our school and the
        kneeling in prayer

        249
        00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,380
        there and so on versus Trump.

        250
        00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,520
        They're kind of a leather is

        251
        00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,264
        there you had one student for

        252
        00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:11,840
        a whole semester and
        then another one came.

        253
        00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,090
        I don't remember his
        name. Maybe you do.

        254
        00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,135
        Shall we had two students
        that first year,

        255
        00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,555
        but the whole thing
        was a great struggle.

        256
        00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,810
        The American leaders
        were very generous to

        257
        00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,060
        the Swedes that I was

        258
        00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,030
        showing university for
        awhile in the seminary.

        259
        00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,540
        I was anxious for orientation
        and I enjoyed it very much.

        260
        00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,650
        But I was in the class
        of of the son of one of

        261
        00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:43,085
        the Baptists leadership
        at the dais, good speed.

        262
        00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,810
        Dr. good speed was one of

        263
        00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,300
        the leaders of the American
        Baptist that help.

        264
        00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,844
        And there were other
        men like that.

        265
        00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:50,780
        >> And there were times when he

        266
        00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,860
        had been married an American

        267
        00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,740
        girl and she wasn't too
        interested in Swedish work,

        268
        00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,935
        but she was gracious and
        she didn't run away.

        269
        00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,450
        But, you know, it was difficult

        270
        00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,310
        for her from her standpoint.

        271
        00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,410
        And sometimes it didn't
        have bread to eat.

        272
        00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,320
        And you can hear
        saying any wife would.

        273
        00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,105
        Now, why did you leave the Navy?

        274
        00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:09,695
        You were getting a big salary

        275
        00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,880
        and here we're struggling at

        276
        00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,960
        all and nobody seems to

        277
        00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,985
        care whether anything
        happens or not.

        278
        00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:18,620
        We can imagine or saying
        that and that was true.

        279
        00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,329
        And you've read
        wreckage, I suppose,

        280
        00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,175
        where there was just
        about starving in it.

        281
        00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,235
        That came some money
        on the school.

        282
        00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,815
        That came a few more
        students all the time.

        283
        00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,900
        Very few though.
        And the thing went,

        284
        00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:35,540
        >> and you may have read in

        285
        00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,099
        seminary records here of

        286
        00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:40,250
        eight Winship sort of
        rules that he drew up.

        287
        00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,765
        Poor association there.

        288
        00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:45,215
        You remembered what one
        rule was the nicest of all.

        289
        00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,640
        Well, anyway, it's this.

        290
        00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,820
        He said this is the rule
        here in the seminar.

        291
        00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,979
        We're breathing,
        nobody has high Lord,

        292
        00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,315
        nobody has King,

        293
        00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,940
        everybody has a brother
        of everybody else.

        294
        00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,294
        And we're working
        together and the Lord

        295
        00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:01,084
        is our Lord and we are,

        296
        00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,835
        is whether children
        saw that irregular.

        297
        00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:06,529
        And that's one of the foundation

        298
        00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,435
        stones that he started with.

        299
        00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:10,610
        And but it's just so difficult.

        300
        00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,689
        There were times when there was

        301
        00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,460
        you just had to be discouraged.

        302
        00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,830
        One time I think you
        wrote his resignation.

        303
        00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,475
        Many just didn't
        descended and so on.

        304
        00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:23,345
        And then his health broke down.

        305
        00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,714
        Now I mentioned three tires,

        306
        00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:28,445
        fire when he converted
        in the dream.

        307
        00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:31,804
        And the fire of the Civil War,

        308
        00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,309
        which he went to, and
        then the Chicago Fire,

        309
        00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,619
        just when they gotta
        going a little bit than

        310
        00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:39,545
        the Great Chicago Fire
        broke out and that reside,

        311
        00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,029
        and everybody thought that, that

        312
        00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,710
        in Chicago, Imodium sank.

        313
        00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,924
        He stood on the steps of

        314
        00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,640
        the old Moody Church,
        seeing the flames.

        315
        00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,064
        And one set to the other,

        316
        00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:50,060
        this bounce, the destruction.

        317
        00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,145
        Chicago Moody had assembled
        some things here,

        318
        00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,949
        but no, they said, Ed, can,

        319
        00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,770
        I think that it green,

        320
        00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,020
        got together some things

        321
        00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,825
        to know what you want
        to put a signal.

        322
        00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,419
        And then he was going
        across the bridge and or

        323
        00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:08,720
        the Chicago River fire,
        we're following along.

        324
        00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,899
        And finally he got across
        time that wouldn't

        325
        00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,270
        have whichever you had
        to climb through potion,

        326
        00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,250
        whatever it was it set up there.

        327
        00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,720
        You finally got to
        the other side.

        328
        00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,585
        You look me a heads
        up, their own opinion.

        329
        00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:25,160
        Just rags or my telework
        said that you saved

        330
        00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,624
        that spirits a lesson
        for us all that well,

        331
        00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:37,309
        that was the Alexis a grid
        he has helped broke down

        332
        00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:43,760
        and he resigned and
        he went out west.

        333
        00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,709
        And it's interesting now

        334
        00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,330
        he's starting to
        photographing gallery.

        335
        00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,700
        They're picking pictures,
        photographs from Sony.

        336
        00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,335
        I do something. His son
        became a great sports writer.

        337
        00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:59,400
        His son may have heard
        that and all of that.

        338
        00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,820
        Well then the next one that
        they call Can you tell us

        339
        00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,440
        more about is family
        like his wife?

        340
        00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,300
        Anything more? You
        mentioned her or children?

        341
        00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,810
        How many children?
        I I I'm not sure.

        342
        00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,400
        I'm sorry.

        343
        00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,170
        Mj Ostrom,

        344
        00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,700
        who wrote the lives of eight

        345
        00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,980
        when it's in your
        library, you know that.

        346
        00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,380
        And then if you I know
        you don't have much time,

        347
        00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,970
        you can do everything, but that's

        348
        00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,040
        a complete story of
        all the details.

        349
        00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,820
        And they were so crowded
        per room that the

        350
        00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,800
        little boy now I think
        that there's all

        351
        00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,780
        these by slip with the student.

        352
        00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,505
        When your student all strung,

        353
        00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,160
        he left the minister sometime
        and went into stake.

        354
        00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,710
        Weren't hostile.
        Very wonderful man.

        355
        00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,240
        He wrote histories and churches.

        356
        00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,319
        And that Dr. Adrian said
        to Mr. Austin Student,

        357
        00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,639
        You said knife, he
        doesn't behave,

        358
        00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,540
        you just give him a spanking
        is actually don't hesitate.

        359
        00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,069
        He said When I looked into

        360
        00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,989
        the blue eyes or that boy I could

        361
        00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,480
        inspect it will consider

        362
        00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,655
        that story. I heard
        him tell that.

        363
        00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,020
        But anyway, she was just said

        364
        00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,649
        an American edition
        and sympathy there,

        365
        00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,730
        there were a little
        bit lack of it.

        366
        00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,830
        Although she was
        wonderful in a way

        367
        00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,144
        that now it was not
        strong physically,

        368
        00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,170
        as we understand, he had

        369
        00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,615
        struggled through so
        much, so many hardships.

        370
        00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:23,105
        And that's a long story
        by itself, of course.

        371
        00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,605
        And then the Civil War

        372
        00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,390
        and then the Chicago
        Fire and all of that.

        373
        00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,850
        The throne in together
        went through that.

        374
        00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,340
        And then he has
        helped wrote down and

        375
        00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,730
        he went west Oakland, California.

        376
        00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,394
        John output Ericsson,

        377
        00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:39,050
        which Pashto there at the
        time, time of his death.

        378
        00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,674
        On No, he was brought

        379
        00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,100
        back across the country to

        380
        00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,660
        a general conference in Chicago.

        381
        00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,120
        That's the last time he
        appeared. When was that?

        382
        00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,930
        Well, 9019191, night.

        383
        00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,800
        We came to a peak of

        384
        00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:05,645
        Kansas in nineteen hundred
        nineteen hundred or 191.

        385
        00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:10,220
        He moved to California in about
        1888 or and that's right?

        386
        00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,579
        Yes. Yeah. Because at
        the turn of the decade,

        387
        00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,110
        Dr. logger Grant took over.

        388
        00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,895
        Yes. I remember that gate.

        389
        00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:18,890
        And I figure let me tell
        you something do check.

        390
        00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,230
        Said to my wife. I uncheck
        on this on myself.

        391
        00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,030
        So humbling to understand.

        392
        00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,285
        But I don't nobody has children.

        393
        00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,909
        I thought that boy told us

        394
        00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:33,335
        about they call
        luxuriant, who, which he?

        395
        00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,905
        Well, he was a scholar from
        Uppsala University in Sweden.

        396
        00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:39,230
        The university, I
        suppose you could say.

        397
        00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,025
        And he was somehow
        related to royal blood.

        398
        00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,389
        That's all we'll
        say about that will

        399
        00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,535
        reunite related to royal blood.

        400
        00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:50,750
        And it resembled hitting.
        Firstname is gusto.

        401
        00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,029
        And King gusto, they
        named him got started

        402
        00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,780
        because he's released
        him there. I suppose.

        403
        00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,345
        Atlas, true, you don't
        want to spell that out,

        404
        00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,669
        but he, he said,

        405
        00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:03,410
        you know, meaning spiritually.

        406
        00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,300
        He said to one of the classes

        407
        00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,764
        and one of the seven students,

        408
        00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:08,900
        and I've been in
        his class, but he

        409
        00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,720
        said he was telling about it's
        wonderful to be in Christ.

        410
        00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,535
        It's wonderful to
        be a child of God.

        411
        00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:15,545
        It's wonderful to have
        him in our heart.

        412
        00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:18,695
        And he said, Dick cone and
        a blue with the desktop.

        413
        00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:22,490
        Although there's King's blood
        in these veins coursing,

        414
        00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,270
        you said, well that was that
        he met spirit to love it.

        415
        00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,235
        The boys thought those
        who knew about it.

        416
        00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,245
        But he had a wonderful mother

        417
        00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:32,405
        and she was a wonderful mother.

        418
        00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:35,149
        Storage that test
        bring out, you know,

        419
        00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,450
        and we've asked about that.

        420
        00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,879
        Well, I tell this
        incident now you

        421
        00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:44,400
        forgive photographer myself,
        I never do anything.

        422
        00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,420
        When we run the farm eggs
        for $0.05 a dozen we sold.

        423
        00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,969
        And my mother would sell eggs and

        424
        00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:56,270
        butter and by calico
        and coffee and sugar.

        425
        00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,079
        Now that's the depression
        days of the nineties. And

        426
        00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,674
        OK, again, when he
        came to America,

        427
        00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,445
        I remember I was
        talking about this

        428
        00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:06,709
        and he said he wanted
        to visit the churches,

        429
        00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,150
        Swedish churches in America.

        430
        00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,475
        There were scattered from
        coast to coast by that time.

        431
        00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,920
        And he was down to
        Kansas and he said,

        432
        00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,960
        Oh, it was terribly
        warm in Kansas.

        433
        00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,329
        I came into a room, there's
        a guest and I said,

        434
        00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,729
        Could I have a drink
        of water is kind of

        435
        00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:23,795
        our polytope and the Kaddish
        violence he told them.

        436
        00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,979
        But the dates, I figure this way,

        437
        00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:29,719
        if you'll forgive me not mother

        438
        00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,549
        sent he was going to come
        in at the station at

        439
        00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,800
        whatever hill town lottery grant

        440
        00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,630
        and coming out of our
        little church there.

        441
        00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,780
        And my mother and father sent
        Albert, That's a seconds,

        442
        00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,159
        and he was Nixon on older to

        443
        00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,515
        my brother Alfred
        hits. You know, AJ

        444
        00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,155
        I was five, I
        figured occupy them.

        445
        00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:47,599
        And she sent us and
        father sent to of

        446
        00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,960

        grin at the sub tree.

        447
        00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
        I mean, little country
        trained, you know,

        448
        00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,300
        and she gave us several
        extra sale and she said,

        449

        450
        00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,350

        and buy candy for.

        451
        00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,850
        Get $0.05 for genome.

        452
        00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,235
        And so we bought candy for $0.05.

        453
        00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:09,020
        Well, when we got to the station,

        454
        00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,700
        we got to town, we

        person and dignity scholar.

        And in Sweden, you know,
        there's a great Git.

        457

        He wants a glass of water.

        460

        That means, you
        know, third-person

        Johnson, who was a missionary.

        two when we met him.

        468
        00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:56,900
        And I was I was

        469
        00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,700
        five years old and I have

        470
        00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,890
        had the time and forgive
        me for saying this,

        471
        00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,740
        but that little boy that

        472
        00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,935
        I think is spring spring
        bucket, we call it.

        473
        00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:09,140
        I was privileged to come to

        474
        00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,150
        the same school where

        475
        00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,745
        Dr. long range to be the
        dean of the seminary.

        476
        00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:15,640
        We never know when
        you see a little boy,

        477
        00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,760
        they're all better than I am.

        478
        00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,710
        And there's segments, you
        never know what's going

        479
        00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,410
        to become a euro.

        480
        00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,975
        That makes the
        difference it makes,

        481
        00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:26,270
        I read that the
        first 12 months of

        482
        00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,304
        a baby is the most important
        predators like it makes,

        483
        00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:31,640
        it makes an impression on him.

        484
        00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,470
        That's ending whether
        he knows it or not.

        485
        00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,810
        And then the article said
        that what did it say?

        486
        00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,165
        That the father should be with
        him as well as the mother?

        487
        00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:39,860
        The father should be
        with him half the

        488
        00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,680
        time or the first 12 months,

        489
        00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,569
        mother the other time
        or at the same time,

        490
        00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,625
        it's on it's so important.

        491
        00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,280
        Well, you know,

        492
        00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,245
        children are important.
        Intends to kill

        493
        00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,510
        my daughter, Hellen,
        whom, you know,

        494
        00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,770
        it's just closing her work now,

        495
        00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,535
        five years teaching the little
        children to the church.

        496
        00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:00,110
        He's done a wonderful job.

        497
        00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,079
        So you've done a wonderful
        job just closing these days

        498
        00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,034
        now and she's resigning well,

        499
        00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,879
        and she had been in that
        work and she's loved we've

        500
        00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,119
        got a huge well,

        501
        00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:18,815
        not Lager came and the
        Seminary was in Chicago.

        502
        00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,365
        It had moved to different
        places, of course,

        503
        00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:24,860
        litres in St. Paul
        awhile trumps pretty

        504
        00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,960
        Nebraska file and
        they're going to give

        505
        00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,255
        them some money if they'd
        come there and all of that.

        506
        00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,745
        But mainly in Chicago.

        507
        00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:33,499
        There were three professors,

        508
        00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:36,680
        Dr. logger in Dr.
        Sandel, Dr. Hindi.

        509
        00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,780
        And there was a petition
        there for awhile.

        510
        00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,530
        Now the generals the American
        bread and were very kind.

        511
        00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,630
        There came a time when
        they paid two with

        512
        00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,490
        the professors and
        the Swedish people.

        513
        00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,170
        We paid one profession,

        514
        00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,984
        we pay log min
        salary, real estate,

        515
        00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:54,515
        and then each of the two
        got 50, whatever it was.

        516
        00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:57,170
        And maybe Dean got more
        of those three with

        517
        00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,170
        the professors and everything
        was taught in Sweden.

        518
        00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,569
        Chip Koch Lager even
        didn't have the

        519
        00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:05,420
        efficient that
        wouldn't go forever.

        520
        00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,190
        He said wanted to their students,

        521
        00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,125
        don't worry about the
        English language.

        522
        00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,490
        Don't try to think.

        523
        00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,520
        You have to. You will never
        have to preach in English.

        524
        00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,770
        It's going to be
        sweets all the time.

        525
        00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,185
        He said, well, he that is
        like a vision, you know.

        526
        00:23:18,185 --> 00:23:21,110
        And finally, finally he resigned.

        527
        00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,415
        He stayed on to long,

        528
        00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:25,810
        many would say I'm membrane
        Bethel Church, Minneapolis.

        529
        00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,290
        He and his seminar had

        530
        00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,825
        a commencement that
        church that church.

        531
        00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,034
        And my pastor WHO

        532
        00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,134
        introduced him or
        something and he said,

        533
        00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:37,340
        Well, Dr. logging and
        won't be with us.

        534
        00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,899
        So very long ago that
        login got up and he said,

        535
        00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:43,729
        when it comes time to resign,

        536
        00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:46,140
        it'll be either will result.

        537
        00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,069
        But even then he had a
        pension and he resigned

        538
        00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:56,420
        then that live to the age of 75.

        539
        00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,615
        And Qi He never use glasses.

        540
        00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:01,910
        You weren't in these
        classes with him?

        541
        00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,305
        He never used glasses.

        542
        00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:05,389
        He said to me once,
        it's a weakness to

        543
        00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,580
        use flash and it shows
        that you're not all there.

        544
        00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,815
        It's a weakness to
        erode, less inhibited.

        545
        00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,795
        He didn't have to use cheaper

        546
        00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:15,230
        and that mattress
        that with lowering.

        547
        00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,000
        Now, did you did you ever
        hear Ed Goodman Preet?

        548
        00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,399
        You know, I missed it or I met

        549
        00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:25,805
        him or when you
        watched in Chicago,

        550
        00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:28,670
        I could've gone,
        but my mother and

        551
        00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,709
        father thought it
        wasn't necessarily

        552
        00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,780
        that I go and they regret it.

        553
        00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,430
        A lot of things. You
        know, we spent a year

        554
        00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,140
        in sweet mother
        ministry children.

        555
        00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,180
        My sister and I. She's
        12 and I was ten.

        556
        00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,700
        We just went to visit
        relatives in Sweden.

        557
        00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,279
        And she said afterwards
        she didn't realize how

        558
        00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,679
        much it would mean to
        have two years there,

        559
        00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,969
        an excursion to stop cone,

        560
        00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,395
        but, but we didn't go.

        561
        00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:51,170
        And the same with this.

        562
        00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,999
        Now, this is in Chicago
        and I wanted to go,

        563
        00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,410
        and I don't blame my parents.

        564
        00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,719
        But they they said, well, Henry,

        565
        00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,390
        he can be important that
        you should go there.

        566
        00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,640
        And that's when they
        introduced him for

        567
        00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,410
        the last time and it took up

        568
        00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,300
        an offering as a gift to him.

        569
        00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,830
        I hope it's big, but
        I'm afraid it wasn't.

        570
        00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,915
        Biggest. Should've is now
        longer granted. Rushdie,

        571
        00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:19,685
        and he wish she'll

        572
        00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,680
        say that she had the
        same lectures year

        573
        00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,089
        after year and you know who

        574
        00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,200
        it's easier to teach and yeah,

        575
        00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,330
        that and they used to say,

        576
        00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,229
        God forgive me for the paper
        on which it was written,

        577
        00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,760
        resume with age and oh,

        578
        00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,700
        good theology and so on.

        579
        00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,520
        And what was it like
        in the classroom?

        580
        00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,209
        Well, you didn't see him
        when he was very dignified

        581
        00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,250
        and he was very
        courteous to just like

        582
        00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,530
        it should be very courteous.

        583
        00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,920
        He said once that
        commencement, he said,

        584
        00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,630
        now when this is over,

        585
        00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,035
        I believe that breathe unesco
        spring out Watergate tall.

        586
        00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,864
        Once you, when this is over,

        587
        00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:56,839
        you're going to run away and

        588
        00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,250
        forget where you've
        been all the time.

        589
        00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,260
        I want all of you to come
        up and say goodbye to me,

        590
        00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,330
        farewell for the summer
        in a courteous way.

        591
        00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,445
        And they did them. But
        he wanted to thing

        592
        00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,980
        done right? And so on.

        593
        00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,439
        And all the students struggling

        594
        00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,479
        for once there two
        or three of them,

        595
        00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,129
        and that they shouldn't
        have done it,

        596
        00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,750
        but they kind of
        start little trouble.

        597
        00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,104
        And you went through
        that and you said today,

        598
        00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,150
        and I know what it is to
        have students an uprising.

        599
        00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,350
        Platinum, my yp, she's

        600
        00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,430
        I don't know. I
        don't happen to me.

        601
        00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,450
        I could understood it.

        602
        00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,250
        Well, those little
        things can happen.

        603
        00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,529
        Uc Irvine might have

        604
        00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:36,379
        might have triggered
        that. You recall

        605
        00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,540
        Maybe he wished he would.

        606
        00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,730
        It was always strongest theology.

        607
        00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,130
        Now, sprite, I know about
        strong, I think he's wonderful.

        608
        00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,900
        Have you ever heard of
        strong salvage? A big book.

        609
        00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,985
        That lecture contains everything.

        610
        00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:50,015
        And that Lindbergh,

        611
        00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:52,985
        you remember that he was
        kind of a insurgent.

        612
        00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:56,645
        He was one of those boys
        club it with a little bit

        613
        00:26:56,645 --> 00:27:00,784
        with Dr. Lander whose
        mission secretary,

        614
        00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:02,390
        Pastor Chuck been happening.

        615
        00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,369
        Elana, you should tell
        us that the coffee table

        616
        00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,965
        that NOT who was right.

        617
        00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:11,375
        There was a final examination
        and logarithm said to you,

        618
        00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,859
        Dr. Laura, and say, do
        you have to you have

        619
        00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:16,775
        to take it over again,
        didn't goodness.

        620
        00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,664
        And our Landry, he was kind of it

        621
        00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:21,575
        senator. He said lot-to-lot grid.

        622
        00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:24,635
        You can either flip
        me or not plugged me.

        623
        00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:26,465
        I won't take it over again.

        624
        00:27:26,465 --> 00:27:28,205
        Wetland mended wonderfully.

        625
        00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:28,730
        Committee.

        626
        00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,470
        He knew he's a good man
        to go out on the field.

        627
        00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,630
        He's a good preacher,
        bright color.

        628
        00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,460
        But I said there's

        629
        00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,080
        a young children are going

        630
        00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,760
        to end up at that coffee table.

        631
        00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,710
        It had reached home and I

        632
        00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,130
        thought you were inquiry
        a courteous to to to him.

        633
        00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,140
        He wanted you to get that better

        634
        00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,800
        and you wouldn't submit
        to His direction.

        635
        00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,770
        He was your supervisor and said,

        636
        00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,035
        well now kinda jump.

        637
        00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:55,910
        You looked at your
        watch and we stop here.

        638
        00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,070
        We got the students
        back in those days

        639
        00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,784
        were all Greek operative rehab

        640
        00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:04,339
        recalcitrant. That means
        that when we start,

        641
        00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:06,019
        we're still kinda jumping
        out of the other sites

        642
        00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,015
        are like how do the
        Academy started?

        643
        00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:10,565
        His brother gave me some
        highlights to talk about.

        644
        00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:14,465
        I'm shooting and I'm doing well.

        645
        00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:17,510
        It was a 103 Brother.

        646
        00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,595
        Dave said what, what
        started as Seminary?

        647
        00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:21,950
        When I started college,
        I started the academies.

        648
        00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,540
        Huh? That's fine.

        649
        00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,270
        And it was a January
        Conference in Trump's broke.

        650
        00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,130
        We had some fine
        churches down there.

        651
        00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,160
        They were faithful country
        churches, some of them.

        652
        00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,170
        And they put to me,

        653
        00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,399
        and they kind of cringe to

        654
        00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,125
        give the two main aggressors
        we'll call Sunday afternoon.

        655
        00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:42,964
        One was Dr. Frank Peterson,

        656
        00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:45,379
        wonderful man. And the other one

        657
        00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:47,360
        was Professor Eric Dr. Erickson,

        658
        00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,650
        Dale, or the seminary.

        659
        00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,280
        They didn't tell them what
        to say. As I understand it.

        660
        00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,249
        They just put them on
        for the message and

        661
        00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,230
        got seem to lead so that

        662
        00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,600
        both of them took the same theme,

        663
        00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,629
        that we need an
        educational institution

        664
        00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:05,569
        in our conference to
        receive our young people,

        665
        00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,580
        especially those who call into

        666
        00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,980
        Christian service,
        where they can get

        667
        00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,269
        not only seminary training,

        668
        00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:13,715
        which we have at
        professional coursing them.

        669
        00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,285
        But, but wouldn't
        it have been done?

        670
        00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,455
        They call it the training
        high school and college.

        671
        00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:20,060
        And now the Lutherans have

        672
        00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,440
        that another
        denomination. I haven't.

        673
        00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,580
        And we are the poorest of all.

        674
        00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,535
        We're a most efficient,
        inefficient.

        675
        00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:28,160
        And it shows that just went

        676
        00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,399
        through which God led both
        of them to just a GUI,

        677
        00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,390
        one with the other in
        that theme and show.

        678
        00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,099
        They took it up and

        679
        00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:43,250
        they see they wait until
        the next year, 1993.

        680
        00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,779
        And my brother and I was at

        681
        00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:46,910
        the conference in
        1904 in Kansas City,

        682
        00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,055
        Missouri, Mr. Pq and

        683
        00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,994
        we when young people
        are working on day two

        684
        00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:55,069
        And so the next year, 194,

        685
        00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:57,740
        they appointed a committee
        to go ahead with

        686
        00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,240
        that and they just heard

        687
        00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,420
        the address their instructor

        688
        00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,865
        broker, then they acted on it.

        689
        00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:04,625
        They reportedly would
        acknowledge next year,

        690
        00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,110
        and they appointed a committee.

        691
        00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,915
        Dr. Robert Earl was on it and
        some of the high efficient,

        692
        00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:14,599
        prominent laymen, as well
        as some of the pasture,

        693
        00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,865
        that they should
        do something about

        694
        00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:20,960
        or inaugurating an academy,

        695
        00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,735
        creating an academy where
        young people could come.

        696
        00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:26,060
        Now, hundreds, a deed
        for the academy.

        697
        00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,890
        Well, there were several needs.

        698
        00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,579
        A good many of

        699
        00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,749
        our churches where in the country

        700
        00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,370
        and didn't have a
        high school there.

        701
        00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,989
        You'd have to go
        to town anyway in

        702
        00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:37,775
        board to go to high school

        703
        00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:40,729
        and show it be

        704
        00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:41,899
        just the waveform to go to

        705
        00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:43,774
        St. Paul and go to the academy,

        706
        00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:45,590
        you'd have to go home anyway.

        707
        00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,014
        And then another thing,

        708
        00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,679
        they would have that
        Christian Fellowship

        709
        00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,615
        and a kind of Christian training.

        710
        00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,819
        And basically for those who

        711
        00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,700
        felt the goddess called him
        into Christian service.

        712
        00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,010
        And so that thing went
        through phi1 into

        713
        00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,985
        Payne Avenue Church
        in Kansas City.

        714
        00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,075
        In Kansas City, that was
        they appointed a committee.

        715
        00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,159
        That committee, I
        think Robert Urbis,

        716
        00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,705
        chairman. I'm not sure.

        717
        00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:10,910
        And I'm sure Dr.
        Ekstrom was on it.

        718
        00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,565
        Pastured eggs from those
        days you'd want to migrate.

        719
        00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:17,119
        Pastures are kept
        him at 12pm. And

        720
        00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,760
        they appointed a
        committee and that

        721
        00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,725
        committee acted ones that year,

        722
        00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:25,040
        1905 to started Oh, yes.

        723
        00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,360
        The resolution. Read it.

        724
        00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,234
        They should call Dr. chord

        725
        00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,785
        to be first-principle
        to the academy.

        726
        00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,990
        I haven't mentioned
        Dr. guard before,

        727
        00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,449
        but he was a wonderful
        scholar and he was a

        728
        00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:38,480
        wonderful Christian and his
        life with beautiful doctor.

        729
        00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,329
        I understand that dr.
        Gordy's just like a pawn,

        730
        00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:43,430
        such a beautiful personality.

        731
        00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,350
        What Dr. Gore came from Sweden to

        732
        00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,629
        move to New York to Brooklyn.

        733
        00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,699
        >> Professor hit Dean and
        we'd later profession

        734
        00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,830
        the Seminary. He
        wished pasture there.

        735
        00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,190
        They had great, reliable
        Dr. Gore was defined clean.

        736
        00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,710
        Yen man. I don't know what
        happened to his father.

        737
        00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,569
        Never heard of him,
        but but I guess she

        738
        00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,865
        had died early. Get
        a wonderful mother.

        739
        00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:05,164
        And he was wonderfully converted

        740
        00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:10,235
        and he fed lead into Christian
        to Christian ministry.

        741
        00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:13,380
        He was small enough stature,

        742
        00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,334
        very beautiful, rich hair,

        743
        00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,750
        black hair, and everything

        744
        00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,400
        about him is Dr.
        Lander's headers.

        745
        00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,629
        There's like a poem,

        746
        00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:28,050
        perfect gentleman in every
        way and a brilliant scholar.

        747
        00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:34,164
        >> I want to say something
        back here again if I

        748
        00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:36,290
        get back to well,

        749
        00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,330
        they in the resolution,

        750
        00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,675
        they said codec to guard
        to be the first-principle.

        751
        00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,670
        Alright? Neither
        were on bare ground.

        752
        00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,635
        Where going to meet what
        I'm going to started.

        753
        00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,240
        What else are they going to do?

        754
        00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,260
        Or they had some good men.

        755
        00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,929
        And that committee
        anyway they began to

        756
        00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,250
        announce at the academy
        would start then follow 195,

        757
        00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,920
        fall of 195 and the helium Church

        758
        00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,060
        Minneapolis from my brother had

        759
        00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,560
        been for more than 50 years,

        760
        00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,539
        essentially could precipitate
        it and still a leader

        761
        00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:05,449
        there in his pad with,
        well, anyway, they got,

        762
        00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:09,004
        they got permission to have
        this Google in church,

        763
        00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,750
        in Sunday School room,
        some Bayesians, so on

        764
        00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,189
        And of course, they started with

        765
        00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:15,590
        two students like the other did,

        766
        00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,870
        because the other day and anyway,

        767
        00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,955
        the first graduation, I
        had just two Student.

        768
        00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:22,460
        One went to the ministry

        769
        00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,005
        and the other went
        back to farming.

        770
        00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,880
        And I've always thought
        of those two as

        771
        00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,289
        representing the kinda work

        772
        00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:28,940
        that this group doing right here.

        773
        00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,114
        Now some are going
        to be layman here,

        774
        00:33:31,114 --> 00:33:32,885
        you're going to be
        Christian layman.

        775
        00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,149
        Some of you who are
        students here and some are

        776
        00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,250
        going at the ministry
        and the college,

        777
        00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,784
        especially ministers
        to both kind we need,

        778
        00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,285
        we need lame and knowledge more

        779
        00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,530
        Christian than we administer.

        780
        00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,515
        Sometimes we think, well
        anyway, the first graduate,

        781
        00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:47,239
        but they were there
        three years before they

        782
        00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:51,169
        graduate and they fused to,

        783
        00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:52,760
        well, they said We need a whole,

        784
        00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,230
        we need a home of our own.

        785
        00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,345
        Shall we do? Where shall we go?

        786
        00:33:56,345 --> 00:33:58,879
        Rather to men and
        Payne Avenue Church,

        787
        00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,800
        Saint Paul one gave

        788
        00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,529
        $5 thousand to start

        789
        00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:06,350
        the building of an
        academy. It cost eight.

        790
        00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,590
        Finally, I guess the
        other one was a builder.

        791
        00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,095
        He put it up he was
        contracted to put it up.

        792
        00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:13,610
        Public beach company too.

        793
        00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,980
        And so that's on
        character and St. Anthony

        794
        00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,859
        part Carter Avenue
        and comb avenue,

        795
        00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:20,840
        that building is still there

        796
        00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,860
        and it was a wonderful time
        when they moved into that

        797
        00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,884
        and shed dished out
        when building I want to

        798
        00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:29,630
        describe that building
        upstairs where

        799
        00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,659
        313 small rooms and

        800
        00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,020
        then a washroom at the
        end, bathroom or so on.

        801
        00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,144
        And those rooms in each one
        of those rooms to student,

        802
        00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,750
        two boys would stay.

        803
        00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,110
        And they used to say that
        they couldn't couldn't chain.

        804
        00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,030
        They had to go outside
        to change their minds.

        805
        00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,820
        You heard so small,

        806
        00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,215
        but there's a bit there and

        807
        00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,420
        maybe a couple little
        desk or something.

        808
        00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,650
        And that little building
        was very efficient.

        809
        00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,290
        Bethel Academy became famous
        all around the neighborhood.

        810
        00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,989
        Their student who refined to and

        811
        00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,795
        then on the first floor over
        three recitation rooms.

        812
        00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,909
        And then they're reading
        room and then the kind of

        813
        00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,730
        private office for the
        for the principal.

        814
        00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:18,240
        And then the basement was a
        kitchen and a dining room and

        815
        00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,030
        washroom and what else?

        816
        00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,499
        Basement. They had a
        steward, the body club,

        817
        00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:29,449
        and they would go up
        the country around,

        818
        00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,070
        I Santa Cambridge around and get

        819
        00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,590
        things for nothing
        from the machine up.

        820
        00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,885
        Things that are potatoes
        and all of that.

        821
        00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,910
        And I remember one year

        822
        00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,580
        and they run the
        boarding time themself.

        823
        00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,160
        I remember one year they
        meals average $0.11 a meal.

        824
        00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,230
        There's the good old
        days, $0.11 a meal.

        825
        00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,490
        And they've got some for nothing.

        826
        00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:55,295
        And then they they
        paid $10 a month.

        827
        00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,610
        Well, Dr. guard was a
        first-principle Nonaka.

        828
        00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,859
        See him yet come walking down

        829
        00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,600
        carter avenue for Mish.

        830
        00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,820
        Hello, happy block up there.

        831
        00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,165
        He wished to perfect gentleman.

        832
        00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,030
        It was spiritual
        to the nth degree.

        833
        00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,610
        And then my brother came there
        to teach in 1927 or eight.

        834
        00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,170
        And I came there in 1987.

        835
        00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,579
        And I came in 1910,

        836
        00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,140
        figured out along radiation.

        837
        00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,790
        I came in 1910 and I took
        over as best I could think.

        838
        00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,390

        good to paste. I English.

        Nice College couple.
        Washington University.

        840
        00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,109
        Kathy I with

        841
        00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:38,464
        University of Minnesota a
        great deal of the time.

        842
        00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,205
        >> And then elsewhere too.

        843
        00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:42,680
        Well, anyway, the
        students repeatedly,

        844
        00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,269
        there were 18 students
        than they were

        845
        00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,120
        22 and then there
        were 39. We had it.

        846
        00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,820
        And finally, when we moved away,

        847
        00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:55,280
        my brother guard
        resigned in 1914.

        848
        00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,229
        He was there from

        849
        00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:00,170
        195 to nine that's nine years,
        if that if that's right.

        850
        00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,240
        But you see, he had
        prepared for the ministry.

        851
        00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,715
        He had studied gotta
        ductus Luther Seminary.

        852
        00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:07,175
        And he studied another colleague,
        distinguished scholar.

        853
        00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,870
        He was brilliant and

        854
        00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,700
        he felt that he trained
        for the pasture it

        855
        00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,079
        and and not to be pens but

        856
        00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,990
        an academy though he
        didn't paperwork there.

        857
        00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,570
        Nobody was there. Then he

        858
        00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,239
        was called to New York.
        He was in New York,

        859
        00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,464
        >> wash my church there and,

        860
        00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:25,940
        and then other churches
        there and East.

        861
        00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,665
        And that was his love.

        862
        00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:29,570
        And when he was, later on,

        863
        00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,770
        I'll just mentioned quickly,

        864
        00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,215
        when they calling back
        to their Seminary,

        865
        00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:37,205
        they almost competitive
        become Dr. Robert URL.

        866
        00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,175
        This district takes a jump
        ahead, not for a moment.

        867
        00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,115
        Later on they calling back
        to be dean of the seminary.

        868
        00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:45,110
        And he felt the pastured
        residual work because

        869
        00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,030
        you have to be careful and rub.

        870
        00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,520
        And Robert or went
        to that church.

        871
        00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,669
        Dr. Haig stone was there and they

        872
        00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,349
        urge the church to release

        873
        00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:57,260
        him and he didn't wanna
        go, what would you do?

        874
        00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,390
        They said now there's,
        there's wonderful work.

        875
        00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,480
        This is training in
        men and this dish is

        876
        00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,900
        more important than the
        bastard, yes or no.

        877
        00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,090
        And Gordon, you want
        to go but he couldn't.

        878
        00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,900
        He just couldn't get over
        their opposition to a stain.

        879
        00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,609
        You might see it
        that way. He loved

        880
        00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:15,260
        administrate and they loved him.

        881
        00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,549
        We came to the chip Greg,

        882
        00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:19,700
        he was and one woman who
        was pasture and weird

        883
        00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,910
        and I was there and
        one woman said to me,

        884
        00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,635
        oh, you should have.
        You should have been.

        885
        00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,020
        In those days, it was
        Dr. gourd pastor.

        886
        00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,610
        If it's just a wonderful she kept

        887
        00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,320
        saying just so wonderful person,

        888
        00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,910
        wonderfully, she could say

        889
        00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,015
        the word so wonderful
        when gardeners here.

        890
        00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:37,520
        When I was called away
        from that to be principal,

        891
        00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,694
        to be dean of the seminary that

        892
        00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:42,215
        others have to we're going
        to be got going that way.

        893
        00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:44,735
        But to, Well then,

        894
        00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:48,350
        now then the two schools united.

        895
        00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,614
        The seminary in Chicago,

        896
        00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:53,885
        which move by the January
        Conference to St. Paul

        897
        00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:58,190
        and the academy and
        disseminate where to unite.

        898
        00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,125
        They required only academy
        education to enter it.

        899
        00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,470
        In fact, they took them at
        first from the eighth grade.

        900
        00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,850
        It came from Sweden.

        901
        00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,940
        And they didn't require
        much if they knew the Lord

        902
        00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,800
        and wanted to give
        me subduing him and

        903
        00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,960
        had some ability and
        there were good pasture,

        904
        00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,415
        say preach a gospel.

        905
        00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:15,560
        And so Guard resigned in

        906
        00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,880
        1914 and went to

        907
        00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,890
        New York as pasture
        unto the church at him.

        908
        00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,250
        And then he was called back
        as Dean later and so on.

        909
        00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,189
        Now let me close with something

        910
        00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,800
        else about ingrain digest
        slipped my mind him talking.

        911
        00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,564
        So Patch eight Green was
        a brilliant scholar,

        912
        00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:37,100
        he was a scientific mind.

        913
        00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,680
        He traveled much as a saver.

        914
        00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,770
        And it also says in his
        book, and I think I'm right,

        915
        00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,475
        that he knew 32
        languages somewhat,

        916
        00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:49,805
        but he could speak
        fluently 16 languages.

        917
        00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,994
        Now there's a mind for you,

        918
        00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:55,040
        and I told you about the
        commoners saying to him,

        919
        00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,119
        the head of the navy said,

        920
        00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,695
        you're, you're making a mistake.

        921
        00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,749
        You futures before you,

        922
        00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:02,210
        a glowing future,
        all your ability.

        923
        00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,560
        I have another call, sir.

        924
        00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,555
        Thank you. But I
        have another call.

        925
        00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:08,600
        And you've heard of
        the Rosetta Stone.

        926
        00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,780
        That was another stone
        like the Rosetta Stone.

        927
        00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,340
        I forget what they call it.

        928
        00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,439
        And the scientists were

        929
        00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:19,970
        just were not agreed on some
        of the interpretation there.

        930
        00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,675
        And they heard of Dr. Adrian,

        931
        00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:27,559
        he had a miraculous mine

        932
        00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,009
        he did had and just
        think his body was,

        933
        00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:33,365
        was, was strong and all
        these troubles paying.

        934
        00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:36,770
        And so they sent it
        to Dr. Adrian for

        935
        00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,810
        his interpretation and he

        936
        00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,510
        gave them his interpretation
        and they accepted it.

        937
        00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,570
        And they got together on they
        took his they accepted it.

        938
        00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,705
        Put that with no Hudson
        Austin's book, I'm sure.

        939
        00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:52,894
        So on this quantum
        artists to yes,

        940
        00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:55,310
        he was an artist from you

        941
        00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:58,070
        and that we've had
        in the old seminary.

        942
        00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,510
        I don't have any here now.

        943
        00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,459
        Painting that he had
        made that had been

        944
        00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,790
        made and it can just do
        that for recreation.

        945
        00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,800
        Edwin? Oh, yeah.

        946
        00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,025
        There are others that
        are still in existence.

        947
        00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:13,550
        Human persons up his paintings
        though we have to push,

        948
        00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,245
        will be somewhere
        around or maybe more.

        949
        00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:17,269
        Yes, there and I'm going to

        950
        00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,910
        restore it and framed properly.

        951
        00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,830
        I was in a home in California

        952
        00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,750
        and staying as guest overnight.

        953
        00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,465
        And in Oakland, I
        guess it was because

        954
        00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,399
        the church needs to be

        955
        00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,410
        there and he had a
        painting issues.

        956
        00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,135
        Just painting was made by
        a DC-10 said and I got it.

        957
        00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:38,629
        I think Peter when he said he'd

        958
        00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,400
        been had it there and he didn't

        959
        00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,170
        seem to need to try
        anything like that.

        960
        00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,660
        And he said could I thought
        that could I buy that?

        961
        00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,620
        Dr. Edgar Paraview and
        they'd go ahead and take it.

        962
        00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,559
        He says, I want anonymous
        either with Hamas or whether it

        963
        00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,330
        touches up s'mores has gotten
        so they're able to $5.

        964
        00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,190
        Just gave him the picture.

        965
        00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,960
        You see? Yes, it was an artist.

        966
        00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,700
        And what else can
        you say about him?

        967
        00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,244
        That he was, he was,

        968
        00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:05,584
        he was a marvelous mine

        969
        00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:11,040
        >> and yet make like this
        will start on the other side.

        970
        00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,979
        Yes,

        971
        00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,969
        you see

        972
        00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,669
        these

        973
        00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:02,820
        two

        974
        00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,485
        verses

        975
        00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:23,640
        on this side?

        976
        00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,949
        Hi,

        977
        00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,730
        yes.

        00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,930
        I think it's time for
        us to begin today.

        2
        00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,364
        In the next couple of weeks,

        3
        00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:15,639
        we are going to be

        4
        00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,519
        shifting gears in the
        class and looking

        5
        00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,149
        specific areas of the world and

        6
        00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:25,300
        using them as case studies to
        test some of the biblical,

        7
        00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,790
        theological and historical study

        8
        00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,440
        of mission that we have had up to

        9
        00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,430
        this in your textbook that came.

        10
        00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,075
        What you will be reading

        11
        00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:41,440
        in the tale about

        12
        00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,880
        a variety of mission
        areas in the world.

        13
        00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,130
        Michael Caine has pulled together

        14
        00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,769
        the most recent
        compilation of what is

        15
        00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:55,370
        going on in the world mission.

        16
        00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,800
        It's not exciting reading,

        17
        00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,990
        except if you happen
        to be particularly

        18
        00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,945
        interested in one area
        of the world or other.

        19
        00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:08,419
        There's a great
        collection of data names,

        20
        00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:10,730
        dates, and so on.

        21
        00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,099
        But you should be
        familiar with what's

        22
        00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,840
        going on around the world.

        23
        00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,330
        And cane fills in all
        the gaps which we would

        24
        00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,840
        possibly be able to
        capture here in class.

        25
        00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,384
        And I encourage you
        to read that and

        26
        00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,944
        read it carefully because

        27
        00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:29,120
        for your own education,

        28
        00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,649
        ought to be aware of what

        29
        00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,055
        the Christian church is
        doing throughout the world.

        30
        00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:35,360
        Not only in terms of

        31
        00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,879
        missionaries that we
        sent from America,

        32
        00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,500
        but in terms of many of

        33
        00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,929
        the indigenous
        movements and so on,

        34
        00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,840
        around the world are
        some exciting stories of

        35
        00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,850
        what is happening
        in the Church of

        36
        00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,370
        Jesus Christ in many
        areas of the world.

        37
        00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,530
        And I'm a little frightened by

        38
        00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,200
        the present trend
        within our own country,

        39
        00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,915
        particularly among the
        younger generations.

        40
        00:01:56,915 --> 00:02:00,049
        Now kind of Neil,
        isolationism in America,

        41
        00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,329
        which subtracts us from

        42
        00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:06,395
        our involvement are places
        in the world, Latin America.

        43
        00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:09,169
        We see it in our foreign policy

        44
        00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,670
        of the Cries about arc one
        policy from groups in America.

        45
        00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,345
        And many of these voices
        are the voices of beyond.

        46
        00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,940
        I hope that you
        aren't captivated,

        47
        00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,990
        at least in terms of your
        Christian outlook by this neil,

        48
        00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,975
        isolationism, exciting things
        going on in the world.

        49
        00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,660
        Are not those going
        on in America?

        50
        00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,180
        Many things in other
        parts of the world.

        51
        00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,935
        And I want you to be
        familiar with those.

        52
        00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:39,905
        That's the reason
        for your reading?

        53
        00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:44,690
        K? I'm well aware from
        my own reading it

        54
        00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,589
        came that in some instances

        55
        00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,539
        not going to be heavily
        stimulate others. You, well,

        56
        00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,315
        I want you to read it unless
        in class we are going

        57
        00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,974
        to be zeroing in on a series

        58
        00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:04,900
        of particular areas
        of the world in

        59
        00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,569
        an attempt to see in a case study

        60
        00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,530
        some of the larger implications
        of mission study itself.

        61
        00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,620
        For example, this time Friday,

        62
        00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,165
        I hope to look at one or
        two specific areas in Asia.

        63
        00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,659
        Next Wednesday, I
        wanted to do the same

        64
        00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,725
        with one or two particular
        countries in Africa.

        65
        00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:29,980
        That following Friday, I've

        66
        00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,229
        invited Charlie D1,
        Chippewa Indian

        67
        00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,769
        To come to focus in on

        68
        00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,579
        mission the Christian church
        within the Indian community,

        69
        00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,680
        particularly here in Minnesota.

        70
        00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,769
        Charlie d1, if an Indian
        himself, as I've mentioned,

        71
        00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,110
        and he's been acquainted with

        72
        00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,749
        the activities of the
        American Indian Movement,

        73
        00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,760
        has been involved with
        that in the past.

        74
        00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,309
        Now, working on the health
        needs of the Indians

        75
        00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:59,280
        in Minneapolis is
        a Christian man.

        76
        00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,770
        >> Okay, I think we're all set.

        77
        00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:11,375
        Well, I came in 1910 and
        gardeners still there.

        78
        00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,765
        My brother was kind of an
        assistant productive guard.

        79
        00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:18,530
        He had charged to the
        making the schedules for

        80
        00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,165
        the students and and

        81
        00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,680
        different students
        had different jobs.

        82
        00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,479
        They want to get away
        early and could they

        83
        00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,640
        get the classes personally
        in the morning?

        84
        00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,740
        And one teacher that's
        missed Swensen came

        85
        00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,749
        to St. Paul and she she wanted

        86
        00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,420
        to not have to come

        87
        00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,619
        early and she wanted to leave

        88
        00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,840
        early because she had
        something on my brother.

        89
        00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,629
        He he'd work on act on
        that schedule and every

        90
        00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,959
        year he got everybody.
        It is a miracle

        91
        00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,950
        by the light, be the token
        with my big brother.

        92
        00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,710
        And he has meant I could
        tell it to read my books.

        93
        00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,190
        Sometimes they attribute data.

        94
        00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,625
        We just opened it and
        remember that influences.

        95
        00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:03,425
        Well anyway, he'd been
        went the other way.

        96
        00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:06,680
        We were working a lot with
        little fellow. I was there.

        97
        00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,090
        I was five years,

        98
        00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,515
        almost five years
        younger than he.

        99
        00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:12,110
        And he picked up that used
        to pick up cigar butts,

        100
        00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,580
        cigarette butts, kitchen,

        101
        00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,749
        I used to do with the OT do yet,

        102
        00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,145
        maybe probably not though.

        103
        00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,989
        He picked up a cigar
        and I thought it was

        104
        00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,730
        going to do that. He
        said, Henry with you.

        105
        00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,369
        Promise me one thing what I said,

        106
        00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,905
        but that she will
        never smoke on age.

        107
        00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:27,590
        Now he he could've
        done something else.

        108
        00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,719
        You know, top deaths
        would and I said,

        109
        00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,025
        sure, I promise you.

        110
        00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,799
        Well, I don't know how
        strong that promise was,

        111
        00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,570
        but I knew I never
        did and never smoked

        112
        00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,910
        cigarette smoke smoke cigarettes?

        113
        00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,220
        Of course not. But that's
        the way he could've led me.

        114
        00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,175
        As I say in the book,
        he led me down.

        115
        00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,295
        He led me up and all
        the rest of the way.

        116
        00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:47,600
        He wish he would want to

        117
        00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,550
        encourage them into
        everything you've ever done.

        118
        00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,430
        I'm going to quit school,
        go to school, you should.

        119
        00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,990
        Henry and I went and I mean,

        120
        00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,059
        he persuaded me and just all

        121
        00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,880
        the way through,
        he'd been wonderful.

        122
        00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,970
        Well, he came, he
        became principal.

        123
        00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,279
        Then after Dr. Gore had left

        124
        00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,320
        and he loved music,

        125
        00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,150
        used to sing songs.
        We sing duets.

        126
        00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,054
        You can do it on the telephone,

        127
        00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,425
        country telephone,
        and in the churches.

        128
        00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,814
        And the first show me saying I'm

        129
        00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:20,134
        inviting some of the song

        130
        00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,700
        and matter railroads
        were saying everywhere.

        131
        00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,440
        And then ten or ending soprano,

        132
        00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
        I guess Japan or Beijing.

        133
        00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,540
        And he'd come home from
        college, Williams Jr. College.

        134
        00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,159
        We take a long walk and
        you tell me everything

        135
        00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,125
        happened in a school
        and everything.

        136
        00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,680
        He was he was just a terrific
        influence in my life.

        137
        00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,590
        And I've got that
        written up in the book.

        138
        00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,995
        When it came to music
        used to sing solos

        139
        00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:52,190
        He was also an athlete who's
        on the varsity football team

        140
        00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,160
        at Williams College
        and Kansas City there.

        141
        00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,509
        And so when he became principal,

        142
        00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,590
        the Academy, he could
        use those talents.

        143
        00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,570
        And the organized
        every year a may,

        144
        00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,119
        of course, metal Academy gave

        145
        00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,950
        a concert that twin
        city church and we

        146
        00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,035
        were the pet to the
        Trinity Church.

        147
        00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,120
        There little opposition
        between Chicago

        148
        00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,070
        and Cemetery and academy.

        149
        00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,799
        There's kind of a fiction
        friction there in

        150
        00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:25,190
        a mild way or sheep and they
        turn out they pack a chair.

        151
        00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,449
        It can never that
        contract came out

        152
        00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,830
        from Bethel Academy and for

        153
        00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,279
        other things for Bethel
        Academy. And then

        154
        00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,630
        he had an amusing and then
        his athletic prowess.

        155
        00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,360
        And he was able to lead the
        boys athletics and leave

        156
        00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,285
        the field day athletic.

        157
        00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:44,570
        And he did a great work
        and quiet Pele and up.

        158
        00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,699
        But he yeah, that's

        159
        00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,530
        the way he's been IBS
        you pretend there for

        160
        00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,820
        50 years and more and he's
        still a strength in that.

        161
        00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,670
        Chair members of the
        Board of Trustees

        162
        00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,220
        he picked up on the street
        and come to Sunday School.

        163
        00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,870
        The man that shipped
        in the Sunday School

        164
        00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,490
        picked him years ago.

        165
        00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,395
        Tell me a story about that.

        166
        00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,180
        And it's a real all
        the way through.

        167
        00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,889
        I was coming from
        some meetings up in

        168
        00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,090
        northern Minnesota and
        I was on a bus Sunday

        169
        00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,599
        night and Bush was almost
        empty and I show how to get

        170
        00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,950
        on the bus kind of

        171
        00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,290
        drunk and another fellow
        saying goodbye to him.

        172
        00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,480
        And I kind of hope
        selfishly you wouldn't sit

        173
        00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,409
        down drug or clinic Christian,

        174
        00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,720
        you know, and he

        175
        00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,600
        came and said that
        brings you to pull out.

        176
        00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,960
        His players have a
        great favor, vacuous.

        177
        00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,294
        And he took it pretty soon again,

        178
        00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:42,410
        you know, we had it
        would have a drink.

        179
        00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,324
        Neighbor actually about
        the third time he said

        180
        00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,290
        by any chance him and it's true.

        181
        00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,060
        And I told him what I was doing.

        182
        00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,350
        Oh, I'm so sorry.

        183
        00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,135
        He said, hi, I don't
        drink, I don't dream.

        184
        00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,590
        But, you know, it's terrible.

        185
        00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,730
        I'm going back to the worn

        186
        00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,695
        out going back to
        our station there.

        187
        00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,605
        And I just have my wife
        and children with his

        188
        00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:06,950
        with her folks know I'm going
        back and it's terrible.

        189
        00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,970
        What do you think about this?

        190
        00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,499
        War is a terrible,

        191
        00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,285
        terrible, and so on.

        192
        00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,920
        And then he told me,

        193
        00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,155
        you belong in the
        spiritualist church.

        194
        00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,640
        He belonged who had
        come to church,

        195
        00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,440
        which they're kind people.

        196
        00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,289
        And about Jerry, he said,
        I don't want to drink,

        197
        00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:23,119
        but he got into this
        just to kinda shoe

        198
        00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,745
        this mind and, and all of that.

        199
        00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:29,045
        And he said, you know, I
        live in Minneapolis, I work

        200
        00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,880
        and there's a fellow
        came and picked

        201
        00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,889
        up my little boy
        comes from layer,

        202
        00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,450
        which suddenly went
        on Abraham and he

        203
        00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,040
        said he took that boil.

        204
        00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,110
        All I said was a name wing blade.

        205
        00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,640
        Yes. He said do you know him?

        206
        00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,160
        And I said, oh,

        207
        00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,259
        I want to write home to my
        wife and tell her that I met

        208
        00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,990
        a man on the bus
        who knew that man

        209
        00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,814
        made good progress and have

        210
        00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:53,689
        that whether we had the warm

        211
        00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,339
        talked all the way
        to Minneapolis,

        212
        00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,350
        had a wonderful time, really did.

        213
        00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,344
        And when I got home,

        214
        00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,764
        I called my brother
        has about 111130

        215
        00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:05,450
        and he gave me the
        name of the boy.

        216
        00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,580
        Let's call them sandwich burnout.

        217
        00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,109
        And I call my brothers
        or do you know

        218
        00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,895
        Sam? Did you ever pick him?

        219
        00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,470
        By the name of the father,

        220
        00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,360
        I guess I said and I said,

        221
        00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,970
        You know, somebody so-and-so
        had a boy who picked up.

        222
        00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,560
        Oh, yeah, that was damnation.

        223
        00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,290
        Yes, I picked him. I never
        could get them to come.

        224
        00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,690
        But PK Well, that's my brother.

        225
        00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,389
        You see she now all the
        way through and right now,

        226
        00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,920
        each advisor for the pasture

        227
        00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,510
        pasture tapes that
        have really changed

        228
        00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,815
        you in the in the church
        and even in a loving way.

        229
        00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:40,835
        He believes in prayer and
        he prays for everything.

        230
        00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:43,160
        Well, now let's see what else.

        231
        00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,085
        I know the time came to
        unite the two schools.

        232
        00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,080
        Chicago churches were pretty

        233
        00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,404
        strong to keep the
        seminary in Chicago,

        234
        00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,135
        but they didn't raise any
        money to do anything about it.

        235
        00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,755
        Many soda.

        236
        00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,895
        The academy was here.

        237
        00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,050
        We had one building

        238
        00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,475
        anyway, they didn't
        have any building.

        239
        00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,380
        They borrowed buildings
        from Chicago University

        240
        00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,715
        that they didn't have their own,

        241
        00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,305
        just about we can shape

        242
        00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,480
        and but we had that
        academy building.

        243
        00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,170
        Michelle and Dr.
        Laura said, oh good,

        244
        00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,895
        that'll build little rat hole.

        245
        00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:16,620
        I think he used that
        word in Swedish,

        246
        00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,140
        but he was riots but does go now.

        247
        00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,189
        They had Home George,

        248
        00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,870
        professors, they had nice homes.

        249
        00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,759
        And in Morgan Park, you know,

        250
        00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,505
        kind of neighborhood like this,
        there's only not so good.

        251
        00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,335
        And they did whether Lee,

        252
        00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,400
        Dr. hid, the inductor,

        253
        00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,019
        Sandel doctor, lawyer in,

        254
        00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,209
        maybe somebody else. And,

        255
        00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,689
        and they voted on the,
        the, the conference,

        256
        00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,810
        decided to let all the
        churches in the country in

        257
        00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,759
        the conference vote on whether it

        258
        00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,130
        should be in Chicago,
        orange, St. Paul.

        259
        00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,484
        In the meantime,
        there's a little dip,

        260
        00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:51,110
        maybe 3 thousand I mentioned
        to you by thousand,

        261
        00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,330
        eight thousand on the academy.

        262
        00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,830
        And they had the Academy to

        263
        00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,944
        give degenerate
        handprints. That building

        264
        00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:59,869
        we had nothing to offer.
        And so they got busy

        265
        00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:01,429
        raising money to pay

        266
        00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,965
        off that mortgage and
        they're paid it off.

        267
        00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,409
        And then they could
        say, Now we'll give

        268
        00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,320
        that building to degenerate
        whatever they can do with it.

        269
        00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,270
        And that that's a

        270
        00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,310
        clear and gave it to
        him. He told paid up.

        271
        00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,605
        Well then when churches voted,

        272
        00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,840
        they voted overwhelmingly to move

        273
        00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,120
        the seminary to St. Paul.

        274
        00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,935
        In 1912, we had terrible
        January Conference in Chicago.

        275
        00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:30,170
        And they were talking
        back and forth,

        276
        00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,770
        hot and heavy and something
        like this committee going

        277
        00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,390
        on in New York
        afternoon, Watergate.

        278
        00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,330
        The senators were fighting

        279
        00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,980
        yesterday to hear on the radio.

        280
        00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,440
        They call each other well,

        281
        00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,180
        but they were very hot and heavy.

        282
        00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:54,005
        They the 19201912, but
        they didn't get anywhere.

        283
        00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,970
        But they voted to
        have the converse and

        284
        00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,475
        next year in 1913 into Lou,

        285
        00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,130
        and that became the
        Peace Conference.

        286
        00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,840
        Oh, and there's a
        wonderful spirit

        287
        00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,070
        and that got,
        remember, I didn't go.

        288
        00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,945
        He just learned
        beside themselves.

        289
        00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,810
        Didn't go. But they want to
        they were wished he had come.

        290
        00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,660
        And then they voted to go right
        ahead in the Twin Cities.

        291
        00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,889
        That's a recommendation of

        292
        00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,470
        gender conference,
        almost two to one.

        293
        00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,245
        I don't remember exactly
        what the poison the churches

        294
        00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:23,570
        And that and they voted not here

        295
        00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,580
        to I crashed in this thing.

        296
        00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,425
        They call Dr. angstrom

        297
        00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:29,900
        to be the first
        president of the school.

        298
        00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,729
        Now doctor asked him,

        299
        00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,739
        was a boy who sold newspapers

        300
        00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:35,825
        on the streets of Minneapolis.

        301
        00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,309
        He was wonderfully converted to

        302
        00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,629
        enter Dr. Frank Peterson in

        303
        00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:42,079
        the meeting saying he
        could talk Swedish,

        304
        00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,255
        but he knew English, of course.

        305
        00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:47,389
        And when Dr. Frank Peterson,

        306
        00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:50,809
        who is Chair of President
        pasture that church sent Arvin,

        307
        00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,549
        takes him to Chicago to

        308
        00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,830
        the seminary logger
        and said to him,

        309
        00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,780
        we can't use you
        your canto treaty.

        310
        00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,315
        How can we use your niche
        where you can talk treaty?

        311
        00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:01,190
        Frank Peters and
        wrote a letter to Dr.

        312
        00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,339
        logging that you just see that

        313
        00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,619
        he said if you are
        going to send back,

        314
        00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,900
        the boys were sent to
        you to the seminary.

        315
        00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,590
        You better go back to
        sweep because I'm English.

        316
        00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,369
        Well anyway, IIT logo meant well,

        317
        00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,785
        he wouldn't quite strong
        as I've said put it.

        318
        00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:22,160
        And but takes from his
        trembled Wesley's Swedish now.

        319
        00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,660
        He preaches Swedish churches.

        320
        00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,970
        He would write it in English and

        321
        00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,195
        then his wife would helping
        translated into Swedish.

        322
        00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,205
        And then he would
        preach Swedish issue

        323
        00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,110
        that to wait, you struggle alone.

        324
        00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,770
        He became pastor of
        Chicago when he was 30.

        325
        00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,084
        And he was missionary around
        their four-year gentlemen,

        326
        00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,105
        but can use 30.

        327
        00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:42,710
        He was called a
        Chicago first year.

        328
        00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,540
        It's a large church
        in our conference.

        329
        00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,200
        And he was the outstanding
        pasture in our conference.

        330
        00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,135
        And he had the
        outstanding church.

        331
        00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,500
        He mixed with the leaders in

        332
        00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,270
        Chicago and get ideas, you know,

        333
        00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,859
        the big churches, pastors

        334
        00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:57,170
        there went ten to their meetings.

        335
        00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,900
        And he was very progressive
        and revivalist in the church.

        336
        00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,550
        I should just said
        we had revivals

        337
        00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,770
        and Bethel Academy,
        the old Asian.

        338
        00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,834
        And wish we had the largest
        missionary volunteer group

        339
        00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,529
        in the state university or

        340
        00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,330
        college that has a
        Medical Academy.

        341
        00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,309
        And we had to rely much
        things are happening

        342
        00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,545
        that little Academy I told
        you about a while ago.

        343
        00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:18,859
        And whenever we reached
        a 100 and even a 100,

        344
        00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:22,550
        we took we took a holiday
        when the attendance reached

        345
        00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,450
        to pick a hundred two
        hundred three hundred habit.

        346
        00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,009
        I told that to the fact

        347
        00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,175
        that told the story
        I'm telling you.

        348
        00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:35,930
        They would roar
        every under revival.

        349
        00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,499
        And we had it Dr. Hicks them
        at a commencement said,

        350
        00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,649
        We may say What we will about
        the seminar Academy that

        351
        00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,864
        tell you that the academy

        352
        00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:46,025
        emission school for
        our conference,

        353
        00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,915
        that's where the
        missionaries runoff from

        354
        00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:51,244
        Outstanding genres all crushed
        and a whole bunch of them,

        355
        00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:54,034
        quite a number of anyway,
        Olivia, Jocelyn, therapy,

        356
        00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:57,650
        the retinal array and so on.

        357
        00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,500
        Now the two schools
        came together.

        358
        00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
        90 Put dr. Higgs jump.

        359
        00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,039
        It's just hidden between
        the eyes when they,

        360
        00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,840
        when they voted him
        to be president.

        361
        00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,654
        But he wasn't prepared for

        362
        00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:10,205
        he said I prepared for the
        patch the best I could.

        363
        00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:13,220
        I'm not the man for that.
        And he broke down and cried.

        364
        00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,230
        Muhammad broke down
        and cried when they

        365
        00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,120
        said he was very good.

        366
        00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:25,459
        To remember that the
        Carlisle tells that,

        367
        00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:29,359
        well, anyway, he said,

        368
        00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:32,000
        I'll accept it, you pray,
        and I'll accept it.

        369
        00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,510
        And so he resigned his
        find shirts and loved you.

        370
        00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,855
        Mentioned ten year end

        371
        00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,769
        Took over the presidency

        372
        00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,135
        where we're going
        to have an office.

        373
        00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,444
        He said that wasn't money
        and up in the treasury

        374
        00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:48,295
        of the school treasure
        to go to the next town.

        375
        00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:53,500
        There were no MIT
        Scratch. Oh, no.

        376
        00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,080
        He before that they
        had elected him to

        377
        00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,050
        financial secretary
        of the conference.

        378
        00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,240
        So he had traveled in that way.

        379
        00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,790
        He left the church and to
        do that. And he traveled.

        380
        00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,470
        He visit every church conference

        381
        00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,640
        without taking any vacation.

        382
        00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,335
        Took him two or three
        years to do that.

        383
        00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,790
        And then he was that man.

        384
        00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,529
        He was General Secretary for

        385
        00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,890
        the conference when he was
        called to be president.

        386
        00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,780
        But he was up there in
        Duluth and he went to D,

        387
        00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,655
        said that I'm not
        prepared for this,

        388
        00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:22,470
        but he accepted if he says
        you pray and we'll go ahead.

        389
        00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,009
        And so he started with
        nothing you might say

        390
        00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:28,565
        except the grace of God
        is fake and are paid.

        391
        00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:31,160
        But he started to raise money.

        392
        00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,380
        Oh yes, they bought the campus on

        393
        00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,000
        smelling six acres
        to square blocks.

        394
        00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,425
        They're not, they're
        oblong though.

        395
        00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,260
        And we could have gotten and
        we've got one for nothing.

        396
        00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,075
        I think about the other one.

        397
        00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:46,310
        And the real estate man

        398
        00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,870
        said you can have
        the third one too,

        399
        00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,520
        if you want to for a low price.

        400
        00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,155
        And they said, Oh, we'll
        never need anymore.

        401
        00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,240
        Or some of the board
        that he thought that,

        402
        00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,130
        you know how lack of vision.

        403
        00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,480
        But there were five
        men in their way.

        404
        00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,030
        They weren't used to
        this thing and show.

        405
        00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,259
        They bought that camp it. But I

        406
        00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,760
        landed right on his own board.

        407
        00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,159
        He had Those are
        fighting that thing,

        408
        00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,889
        but it went through and

        409
        00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,599
        then he's tried to raise
        money for the seminary,

        410
        00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,270
        that little seminary that's
        over there in that building.

        411
        00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,699
        They raised, I think
        there's $30 thousand

        412
        00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:16,070
        had cosh and it is
        defined building.

        413
        00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,349
        And then and then we show

        414
        00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:20,884
        the conference sold
        to a real estate man,

        415
        00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:24,185
        that little Academy
        for $20 thousand.

        416
        00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:27,395
        That transgender conference
        got just see from

        417
        00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:31,880
        Minnesota and from this
        end of the line 20 cow.

        418
        00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,800
        And I think that that's right.

        419
        00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,540
        And then they raised
        money among the church.

        420
        00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,589
        It's gotta be that
        through SHA1 and

        421
        00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:37,790
        raise money for the new seminary.

        422
        00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,009
        And I may have one of our own and

        423
        00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,695
        we have going to have
        the building of our own.

        424
        00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:45,050
        But when we solely
        academy building,

        425
        00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,210
        they said know what wedged
        Academy gonna be next year.

        426
        00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,390
        This is 19141915, whereas Academy

        427
        00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,649
        going to go to and so the

        428
        00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,869
        graciously arranged this way

        429
        00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,569
        that the academy
        could have clashing

        430
        00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:03,380
        that fore noon and

        431
        00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,939
        their seminar could
        have theirs in

        432
        00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,510
        the afternoon and day
        that went through.

        433
        00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,715
        And we did that for two years.

        434
        00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,920
        I think there's two
        year, something

        435
        00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,765
        like that, maybe a little more.

        436
        00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:16,280
        My brother called me on the phone

        437
        00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,810
        the other day and
        he should Henry,

        438
        00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,210
        do you know that
        this is a day that

        439
        00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,875
        nine of the ninth of
        May when we moved

        440
        00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,764
        after the college
        building was really

        441
        00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,910
        the big academy
        building was put up.

        442
        00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,305
        Then when that was finished.

        443
        00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:31,970
        And we can move from
        the seminar with

        444
        00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,970
        all our panel shelves and things.

        445
        00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,860
        And all the students
        jumped into it as

        446
        00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,720
        a holiday to carry overhaul

        447
        00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,040
        the magnificent furniture
        to that new building,

        448
        00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,764
        three story building,

        449
        00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:47,255
        which had been the college
        building now for years.

        450
        00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:50,645
        It was a nine the MAY
        matrices celebration

        451
        00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:55,415
        and ninth of May, 1916 or 17.

        452
        00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:57,410
        But you haven't oftentime

        453
        00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,195
        getting the money for
        that colleague building?

        454
        00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:01,430
        I visited, I was just a teacher.

        455
        00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,430
        I visited 50 churches one summer,

        456
        00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,650
        among those who
        were raising money.

        457
        00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,449
        I visited 50 churches and next
        summer and hot, you know,

        458
        00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:13,280
        I had 5-stage to visit churches,

        459
        00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,629
        him and I'd be on

        460
        00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,399
        those hot branch lines and dust

        461
        00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,230
        coming in through
        the open window.

        462
        00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,585
        But sort of hace
        you wanted it open.

        463
        00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,849
        And then I had a lecture I

        464
        00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,820
        gave everywhere in three,
        the three I'd men.

        465
        00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,625
        But either three i this i
        this i this, i spirit July.

        466
        00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,710
        And they wonder about
        that. I'd be at three.

        467
        00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,134
        I met one man,

        468
        00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,725
        officer the war Abidjan,

        469
        00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,449
        and he said, what's
        that fellow lecturing

        470
        00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,920
        on his yet communism or shopping?

        471
        00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,295
        So he goes said, you though,

        472
        00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:46,190
        hopefully I've met, but I got so

        473
        00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,264
        tired and after the service

        474
        00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,019
        stay with the pastor and he

        475
        00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:53,030
        never saw anybody really
        ill. And so you'd like

        476
        00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,460
        to talk to me robots
        and we'd have

        477
        00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,010
        coffee that I couldn't
        go to sleep very

        478
        00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,920
        well after the
        coffee and the next

        479
        00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,265
        morning at another train
        through the dust storms.

        480
        00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,245
        And I've aged 50 churches.

        481
        00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,790
        I sang a solo.

        482
        00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,325
        It was Swedish, so yeah,
        it's a beautiful thing.

        483

        People way, hey, the
        blood 10-year Yes.

        Mr. Ben translate.

        488
        00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,339
        We're journeying
        through on the way to

        490
        00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,710
        And there's one verse
        step, might shoot

        491
        00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,840

        that I was traveling with,

        493
        00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,920
        you know, I guess I give it gives

        494
        00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,095
        a second shoot anyway
        and which ones are good?

        495
        00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,690
        And one verses to say it would

        496
        00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,915
        be kind of bought up at
        Barnard good in years,

        497
        00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,610
        but you may not see it.

        498
        00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,560
        An snake, you see it.

        499

        bought out your hot.

        500
        00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,380
        I sit Mitchum, look at
        me and you're Watson.

        501
        00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,839
        This was an in-depth
        look at me and

        502
        00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,780
        you wonder how it could be
        that he's a breadth of drugs.

        503
        00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,699
        But listen, you haven't seen

        504
        00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,770
        the real bribe to suit the width.

        505
        00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,880
        This is just about traveling

        506
        00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,619
        suit and fit it in because I was

        507
        00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,340
        traveling and I remember they'd
        little rags here. Wagner,

        508
        00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:19,100
        second suit number two
        maybe would be somehow,

        509
        00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,719
        well, so we raise the money
        for the college building,

        510
        00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,430
        which was the academy billing.

        511
        00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,500
        And at o we weren't proud.

        512
        00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,884
        There's gymnasium and
        they actually food

        513
        00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:33,560
        shop that heating up
        and that was cooking.

        514
        00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,699
        To teach cooking, there was

        515
        00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:37,130
        a business department
        up on the third floor,

        516
        00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,910
        and I had the English
        department all the time all

        517
        00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,680
        through the years until I went

        518
        00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,540
        to Chicago, I'm sure was patched.

        519
        00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,860
        Then it came back. It got

        520
        00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,729
        a little better job I

        521
        00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:54,650
        have to do is live
        and on this side,

        522
        00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,220
        being careless. And on the other,

        523
        00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,620
        another aspect, I
        haven't gotten in

        524
        00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:06,625
        private plenty to go
        to Chicago in 191938.

        525
        00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,610
        I had been head of the
        English department touches.

        526
        00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,380
        It was from 1910 to 1938.

        527
        00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,820
        How long? How many?

        528
        00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,570
        28 years. 28 years.

        529
        00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,220
        And then we went to Chicago.

        530
        00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,450
        We were riding along their
        family and their tent,

        531
        00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,219
        had negotiations back and forth,

        532
        00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,830
        you know, but I thought
        what am I doing?

        533
        00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,750
        Runtime, I do, what am I getting?

        534
        00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,120
        Entry go down.
        Chicago man told me.

        535
        00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,730
        He said, why don't you go to
        Africa and don't go down?

        536
        00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,860
        They then Nest head of Chicago

        537
        00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,390
        Well, don't you beaver ambitious?

        538
        00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,549
        I said yeah, but
        agouti applicant,

        539
        00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:43,720
        he said, don't do that.

        540
        00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,220
        But we had a
        wonderful time there.

        541
        00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,780
        We did have a lot
        of time in Chicago,

        542
        00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,385
        three years and three months.

        543
        00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,130
        And then they were going
        to elect a president.

        544
        00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,280
        And a bachelor's had the
        inductor vectors editor.

        545
        00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,275
        And you should get
        your name on there.

        546
        00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,690
        Know my name on there.

        547
        00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,455
        You know, I can I can Xavier.

        548
        00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:05,064
        And anyway well, anyway,

        549
        00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:10,974
        it turned out that way and
        the whole board could go,

        550
        00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:12,400
        not only the executive board,

        551
        00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,680
        but the whole board of
        the conference tool.

        552
        00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:23,140
        And so it was in where they
        had the catherine 1910191940

        553
        00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:29,050
        comprehension that suddenly
        erupt cord yet men and oh,

        554
        00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,909
        my dean appointment, Daniel,

        555
        00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,320
        he was the other candidate.

        556
        00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,300
        And then I went to Canada.

        557
        00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,355
        She's never have
        to never happened.

        558
        00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:43,195
        But do he'd been a lovely
        tell him that Well,

        559
        00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,760
        I had a kind of
        advantage now, you know,

        560
        00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,259
        you're kind of I thought B,

        561
        00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,730
        all right, the Lord
        wanted me do it.

        562
        00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,880
        I wouldn't proud and I
        thought if that's what you're

        563
        00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,374
        one my wife and praying about it

        564
        00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:55,570
        and it's alright either way.

        565
        00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,100
        But I'm scared, scared.

        566
        00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,670
        You know, Carlos Caribbean
        gave us a good buddy.

        567
        00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,215
        Was going to humble
        little point but a URI.

        568
        00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:08,674
        And so five, Well,

        569
        00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,990
        I was I was chairman
        of the ministers show.

        570
        00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,985
        I was on the platform
        all that time issue.

        571
        00:25:13,985 --> 00:25:16,250
        And then I was vice chairman
        of the kind of franchises.

        572
        00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,155
        And he's told me
        when they say it.

        573
        00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:20,479
        But of course he knew
        his anyway and they

        574
        00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,780
        decided who resolution not
        to discuss either one.

        575
        00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,280
        Ohmic compare notes at all
        and they're getting away.

        576
        00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,739
        Well then that, ok,

        577
        00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,320
        then they're going to
        vote and add to it.

        578
        00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,930
        And I went down head and
        make a call to true basement

        579
        00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,170
        left again talking
        70 hooves trimmed.

        580
        00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,220
        But we went to got cool though.

        581
        00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,019
        But then I thought, well, I think

        582
        00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,640
        that was definitely
        in the voting.

        583
        00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,500
        But anyway, I was elected and

        584
        00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,200
        the first one to hit me was
        the chairman of the board.

        585
        00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,549
        He says, when big,

        586
        00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:58,205
        congratulations, you're
        the one who repaid.

        587
        00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:00,289
        And the next one was o Mark

        588
        00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:02,210
        himself. He rushed over to me.

        589
        00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,490
        Eugenic antigen grabbed
        my hand and she says,

        590
        00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,009
        Congratulations, I'm
        glad you're like, well,

        591
        00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,239
        that spirit, that spirit on

        592
        00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:12,380
        McDonald's had in cooperation.

        593
        00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,180
        Then he was passionate
        Los Angeles.

        594
        00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,510
        Then we called him to come as
        professor to the seminary.

        595
        00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,180
        And then when Dr.
        Carlson patched away

        596
        00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,109
        Carnegie Carlson we
        caught in the board,

        597
        00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:25,310
        caught him as dean.

        598
        00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,480
        So he would deem the seven-year,

        599
        00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,415
        I think types in seven years.

        600
        00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:33,060
        And he's still a wonderful
        fellow. Dino mark.

        601
        00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,069
        Well, Higgs Jim took the job and

        602
        00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,869
        interest and histories
        and difficult job,

        603
        00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:42,395
        but he carried on and he won
        out and the Lord used him.

        604
        00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:49,970
        And that's a picture
        of depression.

        605
        00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,280
        Girls were difficult
        to your Soyuz.

        606
        00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,010
        And now the
        Depression, of course,

        607
        00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,130
        money went far,
        money went very far.

        608
        00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,080
        My wife came home from
        the grocery store there

        609
        00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,255
        and does Israel
        near where we live.

        610
        00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:04,730
        And I print and she
        shady, so cheap.

        611
        00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,710
        I'm ashamed she should
        it showed cheap.

        612
        00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,480
        I'm ashamed. She mentioned

        613
        00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,370
        only patient-level
        money for everything.

        614
        00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,249
        Depression. And we Dr. Actium

        615
        00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:15,680
        called The faculty
        together and you said,

        616
        00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,850
        now I don't know what to do.

        617
        00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,560
        Issue. I've always had some hope

        618
        00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,570
        before, but I haven't any more.

        619
        00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,690
        But I don't see you way
        out or we had pram eating.

        620
        00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,240
        Some students had prior mean
        each with prayer meeting.

        621
        00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,830
        And then we're going to drop up

        622
        00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,245
        the prepare to our department.

        623
        00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:32,974
        Now the junior
        colleagues came in,

        624
        00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:35,990
        but the Lord land and
        we got kept going.

        625
        00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,760
        Then the junior
        colleague Justice,

        626
        00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,010
        there was a need for the
        Academy of those days.

        627
        00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,310
        There now became that same
        need for the junior college.

        628
        00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,405
        The same need obtained
        for the junior college

        629
        00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:53,045
        because now they had high
        schools that they didn't have.

        630
        00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,325
        He's got used to having.

        631
        00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:58,054
        So they didn't go to
        high school and then

        632
        00:27:58,054 --> 00:28:01,580
        Junior College took care

        633
        00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,260
        of the first two
        years of college.

        634
        00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,164
        And then after having that,

        635
        00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:08,120
        that started got
        going good in 1933.

        636
        00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,410
        And then Dino Dean
        Carlson was GUI,

        637
        00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,255
        some marvelous hello Scott it.

        638
        00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:17,180
        He was a history teacher,
        but you can't make KBD.

        639
        00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,499
        And he had the confidence of

        640
        00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:21,335
        the University of Minnesota
        and he was marvelous.

        641
        00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,855
        I had these men around me.

        642
        00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:26,615
        I wouldn't, but they
        were, And that's right.

        643
        00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:30,290
        And so finally, the
        university okayed

        644
        00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,915
        four years of college
        work recognition.

        645
        00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:41,390
        And Danielson, wherever
        walter Danielson,

        646
        00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,609
        who had been missionary
        to a sham India,

        647
        00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:45,920
        he was prevailed on to be

        648
        00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,560
        the first dean of
        the junior college.

        649
        00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,615
        And oh, it was a tough job.

        650
        00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:52,670
        Money with short to beat the bet.

        651
        00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,395
        He cut down salaries,

        652
        00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:58,730
        showcases Have I remember
        Mr. Norris and said to me,

        653
        00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,710
        current dean Karnofsky
        button dean.

        654
        00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,635
        And he said to me he was
        sitting in Duluth looking at

        655
        00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:05,479
        those figures and I

        656
        00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,010
        came up to him into Luther
        countered per share.

        657
        00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,265
        Any shape. Can you tell me?

        658
        00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:09,920
        I can label in this thing.

        659
        00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,600
        They weren't getting
        much to start with,

        660
        00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,570
        then cut half of it to her.

        661
        00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,555
        And they didn't cut. There's
        so much to teach that

        662
        00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,370
        he didn't show much.

        663
        00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,499
        My brother, nice cut
        others because we had

        664
        00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:23,449
        been there so long about

        665
        00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:25,399
        their Wu the school whether

        666
        00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,890
        did and then you
        mentioned the war.

        667
        00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,729
        Dave, Swedish Baptist,

        668
        00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:35,550
        sort of very loyal to
        the ward to the war.

        669
        00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,665
        It was a good thing that
        Germany was so wicked.

        670
        00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,450
        That's what made us show night.

        671
        00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,920
        And that took place twice.

        672
        00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,850
        You know, i was done
        in Iowa for pushed for

        673
        00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,000
        a weekend for the school

        674
        00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,780
        and there was a family
        there had a big fine Farm.

        675
        00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,219
        And I don't know
        what they had done

        676
        00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,479
        to make everybody mad at them

        677
        00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,650
        if they were holding the envoy

        678
        00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,510
        from going into the service.

        679
        00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:05,150
        And they call them slackers,
        who they call them yellow.

        680
        00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,739
        They came there one night,

        681
        00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,635
        the neighborhood, and
        painted all their buildings.

        682
        00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,515
        And the next day he was
        going to have an auction.

        683
        00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,374
        And you see how,

        684
        00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:16,100
        I suppose cruel it was.

        685
        00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,570
        I mean, it was dirty.

        686
        00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,860
        It was to do that.

        687
        00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,605
        And I don't know what
        their vision was,

        688
        00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:22,969
        what the reason they
        had against him,

        689
        00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,320
        how it turned out.

        690
        00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,095
        You were either lacquered
        or you went to war.

        691
        00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:30,034
        Now, how students at which
        you think Amendment, David,

        692
        00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:32,285
        and we had less students
        the seminary could

        693
        00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:35,630
        go because they were going
        into Christian work.

        694
        00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,449
        And that the students in

        695
        00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:42,544
        the academy or in the
        college were allowed

        696
        00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:46,790
        to be free from the war
        if they were lined up

        697
        00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,040
        as minister to training
        from industry and so on.

        698
        00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,410
        But our general
        conference with oil.

        699
        00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,850
        And then you mentioned
        the matter of

        700
        00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,490
        fundamentalism. Our
        Should you baptise?

        701
        00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,095
        Conferences have always been

        702
        00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:04,175
        fundamental as far as
        the Bible's concern.

        703
        00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:07,039
        Maybe they were so
        simple that they were,

        704
        00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,410
        I don't mean that
        in any bad sense,

        705
        00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,719
        but they just took
        the word of God,

        706
        00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,555
        as he says, And believe it.

        707
        00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:16,700
        And we can illustrate
        that in visualization.

        708
        00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,420
        We did hygienes spoken.

        709
        00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,580
        He's got a band
        that he should lie.

        710
        00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,770
        Surely say it. And
        that reenter fashion.

        711
        00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:30,240
        While the whole Bible, you
        know that word of God.

        712
        00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:37,430
        Now what do we have for
        climate conference?

        713
        00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,115
        Hasn't tended to be very
        contentious though.

        714
        00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,069
        As it, again, you know,

        715
        00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,680
        they have their
        goods to the bush.

        716
        00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,430
        Contention was about
        the school, 1912.

        717
        00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,590
        They didn't dare
        to PIDA committee.

        718
        00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,810
        My brother even arrows
        there and he said,

        719
        00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,790
        I won't be appoint a committee
        to study this thing.

        720
        00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,930
        No, no, no, no.

        721
        00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,520
        They wouldn't trust any committee

        722
        00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,590
        that they finally did
        appoint a committee.

        723
        00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,359
        And no, they haven't

        724
        00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,680
        been there's excuse me.
        What was the problem?

        725
        00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,244
        There was, well,
        the geographical,

        726
        00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,600
        it wasn't just that
        the faculty in Chicago

        727
        00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,180
        didn't want to leave or
        other, that's one thing.

        728
        00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,420
        And that they felt

        729
        00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,340
        that we didn't have
        anything here much.

        730
        00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,645
        I mean, where are we now?

        731
        00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:23,360
        Table? They felt that

        732
        00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,760
        the American seminary
        would let them

        733
        00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,430
        use Walker Hall, an old building.

        734
        00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,579
        And they said that ship

        735
        00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:34,265
        the other side shed
        with its an overhaul.

        736
        00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:37,160
        Dr. Robert, earlier he was
        on the school committee.

        737
        00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,590
        Robert, he wrote misuse
        or that thing that

        738
        00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,150
        the thing you zone
        of white elephant

        739
        00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,200
        essential. What did they do?

        740
        00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,850
        Get a tweet, that's
        white elephant.

        741
        00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,340
        And another real estate
        man or a builder

        742
        00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,205
        in Evanston who's on
        the side of Chicago.

        743
        00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:50,615
        He wrote that paper,

        744
        00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:53,360
        let the shoemaker
        state with his lashed.

        745
        00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,190
        He's a doctor. He
        knows how to operate.

        746
        00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,440
        But you don't know anything
        about a real-estate shut up?

        747
        00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,739
        In other words, that's
        what Madison School

        748
        00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:04,910
        themselves because
        they'll have a Ubers.

        749
        00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,429
        And but that's the
        biggest contention

        750
        00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:09,590
        we've had and it turned out fine.

        751
        00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,159
        Do that. 1913, which
        a peace conference

        752
        00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,960
        that my brother didn't go.

        753
        00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,429
        I didn't know he was working on

        754
        00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,360
        the cattle are going to get from

        755
        00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,515
        the next year or something.

        756
        00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,120
        And they said, Why
        does your brother one,

        757
        00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,820
        we want to see him and pasture.

        758
        00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,529
        Hinrich stood up and gave

        759
        00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:26,570
        every part of my brother,
        which was out of ij,

        760
        00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,889
        where he said but only did say

        761
        00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:35,630
        He said he and my brother were
        just close, like brothers,

        762
        00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,864
        you know, my brother
        which __init__

        763
        00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:39,439
        chert pregnant young people

        764
        00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,465
        who've been to Sunday
        school led the choir.

        765
        00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:43,249
        And when I came, I became to

        766
        00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:46,460
        prepare young people
        to president.

        767
        00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,700
        And didn't either
        privately saying,

        768
        00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,409
        alright, began to preach

        769
        00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:52,820
        and travel, and
        I'll mention them.

        770
        00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,009
        But hemorrhage stood
        up there and he,

        771
        00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:58,730
        he praised my brother and
        nutrition true university about

        772
        00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,359
        true lady wearing stage

        773
        00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,859
        where each stage we Room and the

        774
        00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,630
        wonderful family,
        they haven't family.

        775
        00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,014
        She says she hadn't
        got a single fall

        776
        00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:10,459
        and had been quoted that
        he was a kind of pellet,

        777
        00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:11,870
        would put things across
        to do everything.

        778
        00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,280
        Remember who told me? Yes.

        779
        00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,590
        All he was he was he
        had a wonderful patch.

        780
        00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,895
        All my rebellion was every
        Sunday night and so on.

        781
        00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:23,359
        And them, and then they

        782
        00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,510
        had voted through this thing
        then and Kodak to hate them.

        783
        00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,950
        And then this came on.

        784
        00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,719
        And then one of the pastors kinda

        785
        00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,505
        sore about the whole thing.

        786
        00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,789
        He use sarcasm and he
        got up and he said,

        787
        00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:37,729
        Well it's best to send the
        school where the people are,

        788
        00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:39,590
        the Buddhist where they

        789
        00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,800
        either Swedish and I
        did a distant elastic,

        790
        00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,770
        I guess it is best to
        celebrate people are the best.

        791
        00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,524
        And another pastor
        loop, distribute,

        792
        00:34:47,524 --> 00:34:50,240
        let's not have any That
        sarcasm, nice additives.

        793
        00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,520
        And that fellow squashed
        somewhere. It was,

        794
        00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,850
        it was forced out of University
        of Chicago one allele.

        795
        00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,099
        And if they stop,

        796
        00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,870
        they stop the two they had

        797
        00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,820
        paid for to professors
        and they said,

        798
        00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,929
        now you're strong
        enough to pay for

        799
        00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,640
        yourself. That's right.

        800
        00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,540
        And that was one
        thing and so forth.

        801
        00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,509
        But started to say
        that the seminary had

        802
        00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:18,140
        their homes air and they
        had two sons and daughters.

        803
        00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,625
        Some of them are fine.

        804
        00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,770
        And they loved where they

        805
        00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,350
        had their connections into
        churches and schools.

        806
        00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,720
        And it wasn't beautiful,

        807
        00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,700
        Morgan Park, it was
        beautiful and all of that.

        808
        00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,650
        But anyway, what happened?

        809
        00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,515
        Happened and nitrous,
        pretty nearly unanimous.

        810
        00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:38,570
        Now, when they voted into
        Luke, who you there?

        811
        00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,890
        When they voted on
        taking money from

        812
        00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,570
        the government for
        our school here.

        813
        00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,669
        I prayed I was there

        814
        00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:46,040
        at the time we had
        that on Malmstrom.

        815
        00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,765
        I prayed, I said, Lord,

        816
        00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:50,315
        whatever way it goes,
        this is humbled.

        817
        00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,700
        Whatever way this goes,
        Make it two to one,

        818
        00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,130
        so that they won't be any
        digital system in this thing.

        819
        00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,570
        So it'll be so overwhelming.

        820
        00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,850
        And it was two to one
        in favor of not taking

        821
        00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,115
        government money.
        Currently himself.

        822
        00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,300
        Dr. Len present himself,

        823
        00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,485
        spoken to the
        ministers Minneapolis.

        824
        00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,195
        He himself stood there.

        825
        00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,565
        He's my boy. He's
        in my classroom.

        826
        00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,260
        I love him and he loves me.

        827
        00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,194
        But he said to those ministers,

        828
        00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:15,755
        you will never get away from it.

        829
        00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,510
        If you take money
        from the government,

        830
        00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,789
        they'll tell you what he said,

        831
        00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:23,000
        that he, he didn't make a speech

        832
        00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
        and they would be the ones

        833
        00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,690
        you so gracious
        doctor encouraged.

        834
        00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,290
        And this invite, Dr. Len
        crescendo on the platform.

        835
        00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,955
        Climactic Li He shed.

        836
        00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:36,575
        Now we're going to vote no
        on whichever way this go,

        837
        00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:40,415
        whether it goes one way or the
        other way, it's all right.

        838
        00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,540
        We'll just close.

        839
        00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,150
        Irange have worked
        together in prayer.

        840
        00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,934
        Lord that had beautiful

        841
        00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:48,855
        and write in English
        from his heart.

        842
        00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:51,669
        Well, that's good. You mentioned

        843
        00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:56,125
        the strong allegiance to the War.

        844
        00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,940
        Second World War.

        845
        00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,989
        Wasn't the conference
        fairly antiwar

        846
        00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:05,830
        during the First World
        War on its history?

        847
        00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,629
        And I wonder how does change,

        848
        00:37:07,629 --> 00:37:09,910
        while they were such a
        spirit of patriotism

        849
        00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,430
        sweeping the edu.duke endeavor?

        850
        00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,145
        Some, no doubt as I would
        be huge, like have some.

        851
        00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:19,330
        But there were such
        Illinois Loyalty.

        852
        00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,629
        And now that you even
        had to harbor you go

        853
        00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:26,515
        a scant gradations for your
        food if they found people.

        854
        00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:28,285
        One of my best friends URL,

        855
        00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:29,950
        that lawyer in Chicago, earnest.

        856
        00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,320
        He stood up at my wedding.

        857
        00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,140
        Fairness to England.

        858
        00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,229
        He, he's a lawyer in
        Chicago, Principle Fellow,

        859
        00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:38,000
        but he was a private officer to

        860
        00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,889
        go around and
        chicken at homes and

        861
        00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:43,535
        look at they had hidden
        away potatoes are a flower.

        862
        00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:45,965
        And he had carried
        a gun, Revolver,

        863
        00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,230
        and that she, they,

        864
        00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,820
        that that was a crime.

        865
        00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,380
        You shouldn't harbor food

        866
        00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,945
        or stone when he called
        it store it and so on.

        867
        00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:56,600
        But generally
        speaking, I would say

        868
        00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,280
        it and bang it bonds
        was almost compulsory.

        869
        00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,799
        I was in big spring, South Dakota

        870
        00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:06,199
        speaking for the layman

        871
        00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:08,330
        for money for the
        college building,

        872
        00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,230
        which had been the catabolic
        pharmacology billing. And

        873
        00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,745
        they told of a man who came
        over from, from Germany.

        874
        00:38:18,745 --> 00:38:23,289
        He was chairman of crushers
        hearing paper, Jeremy,

        875
        00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:25,570
        and he had made a
        lot of money and

        876
        00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,525
        an officer went to him
        and he said how much.

        877
        00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:31,585
        He asked him about his
        property and he answered two.

        878
        00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,690
        He said How how many cavity
        you had? So on, so on.

        879
        00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,369
        So how much of that
        you'll want to

        880
        00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,325
        Antoine Shuangcheng,
        that's on software.

        881
        00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:41,054
        You've made it an American made

        882
        00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:43,195
        right here in this
        state didn't change.

        883
        00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,069
        And you aren't going
        to buy an elaborate

        884
        00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:48,535
        about, I tell you what you do.

        885
        00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,900
        You go back to your
        homeland, the way of Cain.

        886
        00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,410
        Leave this here. I'm not saying
        that because she did it.

        887
        00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,030
        And good reasons, you're

        888
        00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,890
        not appreciating that you've
        made all their money here.

        889
        00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,689
        You had opportunities
        and yet you set

        890
        00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:07,985
        your foot down
        against cooperation.

        891
        00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:10,370
        Where then the
        Germans said, well,

        892
        00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,994
        what do you want to
        do that and said,

        893
        00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:16,655
        I want you to buy $40
        thousand abundancy setups.

        894
        00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:17,390
        And he did it.

        895
        00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,805
        He did it, he did well.

        896
        00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:21,080
        Cz you had those.

        897
        00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,510
        It did one by month and that.

        898
        00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,880
        But most people did.
        Who could? Who could?

        899
        00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,250
        Every church had a service flag,

        900
        00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,875
        and this isn't very
        conspicuous place.

        901
        00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,890
        The 990s annual conference listed

        902
        00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,529
        every single somebody's
        Baptist border

        903
        00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:38,929
        was in service. So
        there was a kind of

        904
        00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:43,609
        and yet just I had recall
        that tax of Anderson

        905
        00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:46,880
        and read to us at
        our church one time

        906
        00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,945
        a resolution which was made
        that was very anti war.

        907
        00:39:50,945 --> 00:39:54,110
        I thought that from the
        early part where there were

        908
        00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,485
        some of that other were
        anti-war reservoirs.

        909
        00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:58,789
        There were these general,

        910
        00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:01,850
        and I'm just wondering how
        they played really well,

        911
        00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,660
        but it's real sentiment
        was not that well.

        912
        00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,030
        I don't think there
        will your mind,

        913
        00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,370
        but yeah, it was a
        case of patriotism.

        914
        00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,559
        But right now it's

        915
        00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,369
        interesting that she had

        916
        00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,900
        Wb right towards the area
        during all this time.

        917
        00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,020
        What kind of relationships
        did the school,

        918
        00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,440
        and I'm very glad
        close really rally.

        919
        00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,029
        The last years I had
        the honor of being

        920
        00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:31,310
        a close friend of
        Dr. alienated me.

        921
        00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,824
        His last letter to me,

        922
        00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:37,009
        you said that I don't
        know why it was wonderful

        923
        00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:41,719
        to she was in his
        last letter to me,

        924
        00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,880
        I would not see him and
        even when he was sick.

        925
        00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,280
        And so what ever happened to me?

        926
        00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,569
        He says, I may not be here

        927
        00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:50,930
        La Jolla in all the
        years at your school.

        928
        00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,510
        And my school has been
        here in the Twin Cities.

        929
        00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,219
        We have not found anything to

        930
        00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,709
        criticize your school
        either spiritually,

        931
        00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:00,725
        Oscar, elastically, we've
        had one preferred learning.

        932
        00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,245
        And then he said, we'd
        ever happened to me.

        933
        00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:04,879
        I belongs to the Lord. Of course,

        934
        00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,064
        whatever happens to me,

        935
        00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,089
        I want you to
        continue to speak to

        936
        00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:10,025
        the Northwestern students

        937
        00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:12,755
        and where we had that privilege.

        938
        00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:15,170
        And I wish we had

        939
        00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,740
        the January Conference here
        and we had it in 5246.

        940
        00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,945
        I think this was on the campus.

        941
        00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,850
        And I I was challenged
        on a conference.

        942
        00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,920
        Chairman 52. Awesome.
        But on their way.

        943
        00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,844
        And I was chairman twice anyway,

        944
        00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:31,249
        and we've got Dr. Ryan
        and to give a series of

        945
        00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:33,334
        talks to the General Conference

        946
        00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:35,330
        and he's drive would
        come with him.

        947
        00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,009
        I said Dr. Riley,

        948
        00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:39,755
        give us give us
        victorious life torch.

        949
        00:41:39,755 --> 00:41:42,905
        And then I'm going to do
        just what you're saying.

        950
        00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:45,035
        I want to try not
        to talk too long.

        951
        00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,210
        We had it in the
        hippodrome in February.

        952
        00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,930
        She then piggybacked
        on their first time.

        953
        00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,979
        We had to have it another hall

        954
        00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:53,210
        than the hippodrome is built for.

        955
        00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,509
        The second one, environment

        956
        00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:59,150
        was in charge of
        reception preparation.

        957
        00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,199
        Keys to wish, you know,

        958
        00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,700
        I think like readmission.

        959
        00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,920
        Dr. Riley had some controversies
        here via evolution.

        960
        00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,275
        Yes, yes. That's kinda
        funny. At times.

        961
        00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:17,029
        He, he was going to speak at

        962
        00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:20,240
        the University of Minnesota
        and then something happens,

        963
        00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,475
        so he couldn't do it.

        964
        00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:25,099
        And the kind of credit
        abroad that they turned it

        965
        00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:29,405
        down and that made it put it
        out in English, clear sign.

        966
        00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:31,595
        And some president
        Kaufmann, he said,

        967
        00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:34,760
        we'll have him said we were
        not rejecting against him.

        968
        00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,770
        I don't know what the
        cause of the other wedge.

        969
        00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,809
        And so he arranged to have

        970
        00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,989
        William Jennings
        Bryan to have Dr.

        971
        00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,930
        Riley and to speak
        and announced that

        972
        00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,620
        the university so you'd have
        a free reign right away.

        973
        00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,240
        And then something happened.

        974
        00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,980
        Just a doctor, violet

        975
        00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,049
        Kaufman was pregnant. Uterus has

        976
        00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:55,880
        rightly or roaster speech.

        977
        00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,150
        So packed up above the
        ceiling with lub dub.

        978
        00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:03,439
        Amongst the artificial
        monkey showed was that

        979
        00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:06,139
        rescue Fred Ryan and

        980
        00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:08,600
        President COP and leapt
        up like a gentleman.

        981
        00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,294
        He says, I want to apologize,

        982
        00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:11,750
        Dr. Riley, for this.

        983
        00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,570
        It's a prank and
        were ashamed of it.

        984
        00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,460
        You said that was well done.

        985
        00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:25,620
        You've seen in another
        debate name was Dr. Schmidt.

        986
        00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,519
        Yeah, the name is Dr. Smith of

        987
        00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:30,619
        the speaker or the other side

        988
        00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:32,420
        of the question about evolution.

        989
        00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,904
        And he brought a Montague

        990
        00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:39,490
        rather it's published
        match right there.

        991
        00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,450
        And that speaker broader
        monkey and rarely leave.

        992
        00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,990
        We says, I see, I
        see I was mistaken.

        993
        00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,110
        I thought I was going to
        speak to Dr. Schmidt,

        994
        00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,519
        but now I'm speaking to the Smith

        995
        00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:57,670
        Brother's got the government
        took the OD is just wrong.

        996
        00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,830
        And I guess everybody
        around them, Dr. Riley was,

        997
        00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,830
        as I understood it, a great
        brand and the labor and

        998
        00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,815
        the poor in his cargo.

        999
        00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,350
        Yes, but he didn't
        let him run him.

        1000
        00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:16,610
        He didn't let a running VM
        or human friend. All right?

        1001
        00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,130
        He was, he was a genius.

        1002
        00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,335
        They had a debate in this church

        1003
        00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:28,250
        and nobody wish to speak
        with those two speakers.

        1004
        00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,349
        And one rally agreed with,

        1005
        00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:32,210
        and the other one of course,
        he didn't agree with.

        1006
        00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,970
        And when averaged over,

        1007
        00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,350
        nobody was allowed to speak
        notion and interests over.

        1008
        00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,065
        Dr. Riley had been
        an estimate to make.

        1009
        00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:44,360
        And so he got a big announcement.

        1010
        00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,829
        And then he said, and by the way,

        1011
        00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:47,269
        I'd like to say this,

        1012
        00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:48,499
        I think I'll take over

        1013
        00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:49,880
        the preacher purse
        because he's easy.

        1014
        00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,795
        Stan Lee said wonders
        appreciative.

        1015
        00:44:51,795 --> 00:44:55,460
        And then he went and
        covered the whole 6-bit,

        1016
        00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,080
        took away the flag victory.

        1017
        00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,779
        He expressed sided one,

        1018
        00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:05,675
        I think while I think he
        disagreed with both of them.

        1019
        00:45:05,675 --> 00:45:08,090
        So he says handled
        administer versus easiest.

        1020
        00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,169
        And likewise that helped,

        1021
        00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:12,485
        you know, the other
        side how many?

        1022
        00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:14,960
        He covered both of them and

        1023
        00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,330
        got in the what he called
        the truth than the matter.

        1024
        00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,730
        You're smart. Did you
        preach in your rallies?

        1025
        00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,139
        Charity I purchase I
        Princeton at the time,

        1026
        00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:30,680
        maybe that pitch duration and
        Tabernacle Baptist Church.

        1027
        00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,570
        But I preached in 50 churches

        1028
        00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,670
        inter-institutional
        with smaller Jersey.

        1029
        00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,474
        Yeah, I'm Swedish Baptist,

        1030
        00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:41,340
        American Baptist,
        Presbyterian, Luther,

        1031
        00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:49,460
        Episcopalian ones, and
        sometimes junior services.

        1032
        00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,425
        I had an illustration.

        1033
        00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:53,135
        We'll close with this shabby,

        1034
        00:45:53,135 --> 00:45:56,375
        This is beautiful, and
        they want me to repeat it.

        1035
        00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,000
        A man was way out in the wilds

        1036
        00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,475
        of the Northwest United States,

        1037
        00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:04,009
        and he was all alone,

        1038
        00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:07,890
        working as a pioneer
        and he dug a well.
