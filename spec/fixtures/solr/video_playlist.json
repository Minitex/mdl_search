When you were\nworking in the youth team, the mobile youth team?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: Did you see any of the people who were working on the team die?\nYY: Yes. My, one of my friend, not just one, I think four or five, six of them were dead\nof malaria. One of my close friends was, he was high school student.

They said that those\npeople are second force, not a strong front force. So I stay with them, I think - - I couldn't\ntell because I didn't know exact time.

They said this guy is Mr. Yom's son and\nthen the guy said, why we were so afraid to tell and just tell him the truth, that, yeah, and\n- -.\nPR: What did they tell him, that you were your father's son?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: And then what did they tell you about your being killed?\nYY: They said that, well, you are not safe to stay here, you are no longer safe to stay here\nbecause I think in the future theses people are going to come after you.\nPR: Now, why would they kill you because you were your father's son?\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nYY: Because my father is - - was - - a well-known person in the areas.\nPR: Why was he well-known?\nYY: Because he was chief militia commander of militia... and he was a merchant, he was\na merchant also, because the Khmer Rouge hated that class of people.\nPR: Both the militia and the merchants?\nYY: Yeah, because he fought against the Khmer Rouge along with the Lon Nol soldier.\nPR: Lon Nol?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: And so you were warned. Now the person who warned you was doing a brave thing,\nwasn't he?\nYY: Yeah. He warned me. And then later on he said, well, you have to leave and I can\nwrite you the fake letters, permission for you to travel, and you can go and find your\nmom and your sibling.\nPR: Do you have any idea what year this was that this happened?\nYY: I think this is in 1986, but I am not sure. I think early 1976.\nPR: Early '86?\nYY: I'm sorry, '76.\nPR: So you got this letter of passage or permission to travel and where did you go?\nYY: I left the village early in the morning and nobody know that I left the village. I left\nwith the old lady because I, at the time, fortunately for me, there was a lady, old lady,\ncame from a zone four to find her son. And her son was in the team, the same team that I\nbelonged to. And she came to take her son back to \"zone four\". By that time, the head of\nvillage said, well, now is time for you, its time for you, you can go with the lady and you\ncan walk along with her and then when you get to zone four, you can go to your mom, to\nfind your mom, because your mom is in zone four, but just different village.\nPR: Now, what happened to your father?\nYY: When I came back and when I met my mom, I think at night, because I came at\nnight, and I, when I came - - when I left the village, on the way to the zone four, when I\ncame across the highway five, there is a Cambodian - - we walk along highway five from\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nO'Kreart to Pray Sway, and then I saw the guy rode the bicycle from Prey Sway direction\nand I look at this guy and say, oh, I know this guy, I know this guy. And I stop this guy.\nAnd then I knew him right away and I asked Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang, do you know me?\nAnd he said no. And I said, do you know Mr. Yom, and Seun. And he said, oh, yeah.\nYour mom. Then he surprised and said, are you Yoeuth? And I said yes. And he said\nyour mom live close to me. And I said, can I come with you to my mom, because I was\non the way to zone four and I want to find my mom, but I have no idea. He said yes. Then\nI didn't go along with the old lady and her son anymore, I come with this old man. And\nthen when I got to my mom's village, I think around midnight, and then he knock at my\nmom's shack and said Seun, Seun, I brought important stuff, thing, for you; good thing\nfor you. Please light your lantern, light your lamp and wake all your children up and\nprepare the meal also. Then my mom got up and light the lamps and my - - all my\nsiblings woke up and my mom got up and cry, and - - .\nPR: I bet you were very, very glad to find her?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: Do you want to stop for a minute, Yan?\nYY: Yeah, that is okay.\nPR: Do you want to stop for just a minute?\nYY: Uh-huh.\nPR: Was it through your mother that you found out what happened to your dad?\nYY: Yeah. And then my morn woke up and my siblings, my older brother, (Yarn) who is\nnow in Thailand, got up, and my sister now in Thailand, and my two brothers who are\nnow here. And got up, and then my morn just cried, and we all cried in the middle of the\nnight. And she said, well, your dad is gone. Your dad was taken away by the \"ankas\"\nfifteen day after we got here.\nPR: They just came and took him out of the house?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: He wasn't seen again?\nYY: Yeah. And she said, well, at one point when she got back from the trip, because\nwhen my mom and my dad were brought to this village and they allow my father to get\nout of the village to find some forest to build the shack, my father was not finishing his\nshack. And he was taken away. And at one point, I can remember right now, he told my\nmom that would you please take care of children because I know I was not coming back.\nI know that.\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nPR: How long did you get to stay with your family?\nYY: When I got back to my mom and I stay with my mom, because since that night,\nvery, very heavy raining. Then next morning, I got malaria again. I got fever and chills.\nThen my mom said, well, I can report to the Khmer Rouge leaders in the village about\nthis because then to get some food, portion of food for you to eat. And next morning my\nmom report to the leaders, the village leader, the Khmer Rouge leader, and then in the\nmorning, every morning, the Khmer Rouge nurse came by from house to house. Come to\nvisit from house to house, the way that the Khmer Rouge practiced, to make sure that\neverybody go to work. Anybody sick, they can give you some medication, and to find out\nif they are really sick or just pretend sick. And when they got to my mom shack, I was in\nchill. Fever and chill, and they gave me some Khmer Rouge medication. It looked like\nrabbit excrement. So looked like rabbit excrement. So they gave me that medication and\nthey gave me (Quinide) from China, a pink pill. I took that for seven days. And then I got\nbetter and then my older brother was in youth mobile team and said, well, you should go\nwith me. Don't have to wait until the Khmer Rouge told you to do, you can come with me\nto work. Then I was with my brother for a couple months with his team, because my\nbrother team was assigned to transport the rice from zone seven to zone four by boat\nbecause full of water from zone four to zone seven. So I just sat on the boat and my\nbrother and his team rowed the boat because I was real skinny by that time.\nPR: So how long did you get to stay with the family and work with your brothers?\nYY: I was with the family, with my mom about fourteen day, I believe.\nPR: Then what happened to you?\nYY: And then I was with my brother's team and then later on they said, oh, all the front\nforce have to join with the zone four team, zone four team. Then they - - all the people,\nall the youth all the youngster who are not married in the village, the whole village\ngathered together, were gathered together by the Khmer Ronge leaders and then were\nsent to the zone four. They call it youth mobile team. And I was with that team, I think,\nuntil I was sent to concentration camp.\nPR: Okay. When you were in the zone four youth mobile team, what kind of work were\nyou doing?\nYY: At first I assigned to do farming work, build dike and canal and plant the rice, pull\nthe seedling rice. And my malaria keep coming back all the time. At one time, I got high\nfever and chill and I stay home. I asked the Khmer Rouge leader to stay home and ,they\nsaid, well, you can stay home. Later on, they say, well, some people who are sick, is not\nreally sick, just pretend to be sick person. Then this people are not useful to \"anka\"; they\nsaid the enemy of the \"anka\". We should get rid of these people. And one of my group\nleaders came and told me that, well, you shouldn't stay home anymore when you can go\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nto the field, work every day. When you get fever and chill, you can stay - - you can sleep\non the dike instead.\nPR: Sleep on the dike?\nYY: Yeah, and bring your blanket along. So I bring a blanket along.\nPR: You were telling us, Yoeuth, about working in the zone four youth mobile team, and\nyou had malaria, and you still went to work?\nYY: Uh-huh.\nPR: So that you wouldn't get in trouble with the Khmer Rouge --?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: -- who were running the team?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: Can you tell us about the kind of work you were doing? Farm work, is that correct?\nYY: Yes.\nPR: And how were you treated by the Khmer Rouge? Was it different than the kind of\ntreatment you had before in the first front force team? Were the conditions better or\nworse or the same?\nYY: The condition was the same. But at this time, I was not breaking the stone or\npushing the cart from the rivers to the top of the mountain. And at this time, it's just dig\nthe canal and build the dike. Get up the same time, predawn, four in the morning or five\no'clock in the morning, till sunset.\nPR: Were the food rations about the same?\nYY: The food ration about the same, about the same.\nPR: Were the Khmer Rouge -- how did they treat the workers? That is, were they hard on\nthem or did they treat them well?\nYY: The Khmer Rouge never treat anybody well, except the parties or perhaps the people\nin the group, the people who joined the team in the revolution. The people they call new\npeople. Those people were treat harshly by the Khmer Rouge. Any place anybody go,\nbecause the Khmer Rouge, sometimes the they use the whip, the Khmer Rouge team\ncompany, team company leader, carried a whip with them most of the time. If anybody\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\ndid something wrong, not just - - not really big mistake, you know, like you goes to get a\nshower and you just a little bit late, they would kick you and whip you.\nPR: Were you ever whipped?\nYY: Yeah. But I was not whipped at this time, but after, later on.\nPR: How long did you work in that youth mobile team?\nYY: I was with the youth mobile team, but first I was assigned to do farming and later on\nI was assigned the fertilizer team. So I was assigned to fertilizer team, I believe, in 1977.\nPR: You worked on that team for awhile. You mentioned that you ended up in a\nconcentration camp. How did you end up in a concentration camp?\nYY: When I was with the fertilizer team, I carries all the excrements of human beings\nand make fertilizer. Cut the leaf of trees and mix together and all the maggots swimming\naround. And we have bad smell every day. But you get used to, just do the job. And later\non the Khmer leaders said, well, we need a team who really work hard who can help\n\"anka\" zone four, and we need strong people who can carry the rice sacks. Then they\npoint out to the people and the team. And say, oh, we need ten people who work really\nhard who can carry the rice sack, because the rice sack is about eight kilogram for each\nrice sack. And they look at me and they look at the other people. Because I carry, when I\nwas with to the fertilizer team, I carry the excrement, human excrement, big gasoline can\ncut into -- split into two -- and I carry that. And very, very heavy. And say, well, this\ncomrade can carry the rice sack because he is really strong. And point, this one. And I\nwas ... and then they sent me to the transportation team in zone four. I was with the\ntransportation team about just a short period of time. Then the northwestern leader was\naccused the enemy of the central party and they send the southwestern people to take\nover the whole regions. And then when the northwestern people - - no, southwestern\npeople, they call (Nearaday) came to take over the whole regions, then they say, oh, these\npeople belong to the previous zone leader so we should move these people from this area.\nThen told you have to get out of this area for awhile until we set the things smooth. We\nput the thing in smooth transitional way, then we will take you back. But now we have to\nsend you to this area to work for \"anka\". That is when I end up in concentration camp.\nPR: So that is where they sent you was to a concentration camp?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: What happened to you there in the concentration camp?\nYY: When I got to that place, I didn't realize that I was in concentration camp because I\nthought I was just youth mobile team. And I start realize when they carry weapon. The\nKhmer leader carried a gun all the time to guard us anyplace we go. And they carry the\nwhip all the time. And when we got there, they told us, now, you are not -- you cannot do\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nwhat you want to do, you are not youth mobile team anymore. Now you are in this camp.\nYou need to be reeducated. This is reeducated camp.\nPR: What did they do to you?\nYY: Then they asked, I think four or five thousand, all of us, to dig the dam and build the\nroad, dig the well, plant the rice, build the dike, build a stream, the water stream.\nPR: So it was sort of more of the same, really?\nYY: More of the same. But this camp, the soldiers, the Khmer Rouge soldiers guard us\nall the time. And this really harsh, really harsh treatment from the Khmer Rouge at this\ntime at the concentration camp. In the morning, you have to get up when the Khmer\nRouge blew the whistle. You have to get up and then they order you to take a shower at\n4:00 in the morning. And your body is not really sensitive to the waters because you are\nvery skinny and you hardly walk. Young man like me, when I got up, I have to put my\nhand on both knee to get up. And we barely walk. This camp, a lot of my friends were\nkilled, a lot…one of my friend was (Phin Ngan), his name was (Phin Me). He was\nLieutenant Governor son, Phin Ngan), Battambang Province.\nYY: And others, two or three was former militia officer, also my friend also; my friend,\ntoo. And those were killed, beaten to death on the rice field.\nPR: Did you see that happen?\nYY: I did not see what happened, but because, when I was in concentration camp, they\nseparate me from the rest of my team, my former team. The Khmer Rouge came and\npoint to everybody, and then they point at me, do you know how to plow the field? I said\nyes. And, do you know how to tend the cattle, the ox, the buffalo, water buffalo? I said\nyes, I can tend the oxen, but I am afraid I am not used to the water buffalo. Then the\nKhmer Rouge leader says, well, you can do it. So then they picked me out from the team.\nAnd then my friend, (Phin Ngan's) son, Lieutenant Governor son, his skin very light, was\nreal light. And he was stayed there, he was not with me. And I was with another team,\nwhat they call plowing team. Plowing harrow team.\nPR: So did you learn about his death from somebody else that was there and saw it?\nYY: Yes, because in day time we were in the front team, but at night we came to the\nsame shack, we stayed in the same shack at night. So I learned when my friend was taken\naway one night when I came back from plowing the field. One friend came to me, Mr.\n(Meng), Comrade (Meng), Khmer Rouge called Comrade (Meng), came to me and said\n(Phin Me) was taken away today and we don't know where. Since then, we never see\nhim, you know, saw him. And later on Mr. (Doeun), our Comrade (Doeun) was not taken\naway, he was beaten to death on the rice field with the head of the how.\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nPR: Know why?\nYY: The head of the hoe.\nPR: Do you know why he was beaten to death?\nYY: He was carrying seedling rice for another team to plant on the field. And he tripped\nhis leg and fall into the field, the farm field, and fall into the (seedling) the plants, the rice\nplants, and broke a few rice plant. And the Khmer Rouge say that is the enemy.\nPR: And they beat him. By doing that, he was an enemy, and beat him for that?\nYY: Uh-huh.\nPR: You were in the concentration camp for about a year?\nYY: Yeah, I think about a year. And when I perform my job, I saw a lot of dead bodies in\nthe farm field. Because run a harrow, my plow and my harrow, I can see the dead bodies\nand flesh of dead bodies come out from the…\nPR: The rice field?\nYY: Yeah, the rice field. And some, I saw red water come out, red water. And then I saw\nthe bone, the bone come out. And then I have to get off from the harrow and pick - - I\nhave to pick up those bone and put on a small hill nearby. And I was with this team when\nI tended the water buffalo in one the grass land, I saw the (club) of, (club) that the Khmer\nRouge soldiers use to beat the people to death. And I saw the leg of people out of the\nground, sticking out, and the clothes. And I was so shocked and I think maybe my friend\nor somebody who was killed here. And the wolf came by and eat all those flesh.\nPR: The animals?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: Wild animals?\nYY: Yeah, wild animals.\nPR: How did you escape from the concentration camp?\nYY: Until the Khmer Rouge took -- until the Vietnamese took over the whole country.\nAnd this concentration camp, I was beaten by Khmer Rouge and here (indicating), my\nscar on my left eyebrow, is a scar.\nPR: Why did they beat you?\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nYY: One morning, they told me that when the whistle blew I have to get up and run and\ndress up my clothes and run. I was a little bit late and the Khmer Rouge, when they blew\nthe whistle, one Khmer Rouge blew the whistle and the others carried a whip along and\nhit. Anybody that didn't have to get up and run. If you don't run, you are going to get\nwhipped.\nPR: And that is what happened to you?\nYY: That is what happened to me.\nPR: Do you have anything else -- do you have any other memories of the concentration\ncamp that stand out in your mind?\nYY: I have a lot of memories at this concentration camp. I was beaten and I saw the\npeople were killed because a lot of my friends asked me to leave, to escape from this\nconcentration camp. And some of them escaped safely. I met them by the time the\nVietnamese took over the whole country. Some of them were not safe. One morning,\nwhen we got up and then the Khmer Rouge announced by a loudspeaker, we caught the\nenemy, we caught one enemy trying to escape from the “anka\"~. Would you please\ngather around in front of young women center, women shack. And then everybody\ngathered according to the order, and we came and the Khmer Rouge brought this guy, put\nin front of everybody about three or four thousand people -- and then he chopped this guy\nwith the knife. He opened the abdomen in front of a lot of people, a lot of youngsters.\nAnd he pierced his knife into this guys eyes. And this guy scream in pain. And I can see.\nAnd he, Khmer Rouge, kick on his head and twist him around.\nPR: You know, you have described such terrible, horrible things and I can't help wanting\nto ask you if, after awhile, when things are that bad, do you ever sort of get used to it to\nthe point where it no longer horrifies you? Or did you -- was it always horrible to see\nthese things happen? What I am asking is if you ever sort of got to the place where it was\nso common to see horrible things that they no longer got to you?\nYY: Some point, I feel, because I do not put my life in value anymore, I just say to\nmyself, well, I just live from day-to-day. And maybe this day that is him, maybe\ntomorrow that is me. And I don't care. I am not taking care of my body anymore. I just let\nit go. If they take me, then that is my life, that is the end of my life.\nPR: So the feeling was sort of like hopelessness?\nYY: Hopeless, give up all the hope.\nPR: Then when the Vietnamese came in in '79, and over-ran Cambodia and defeated the\nKhmer Rouge, that is when you were liberated, sort of. I don't know if liberated is the\nright word?\nYY: Yeah.\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nPR: What happened, did everybody take off into the jungle or was it orderly or mad-house?\nYY: I did not realize that the Vietnamese invade Cambodia. By the time that the\nVietnamese came, I was sent to a jungle, to deep jungle. Up north, close to the mountain\nthey call (Pahall), very far away from the first place, the first concentration place. And\nwhen we got there, the people around the village, the people around that concentration\ncamp were afraid to talk to us. They never came to us to talk to us at all. Even, I met my\nsecond cousin, the one that I escaped from him in 1976 I met him. He came, he walked\nby, I don't know, accidentally, I saw him. I said to him, (Dorn, Dorn); he didn't even look\nat me. He just walked by. He passed away, he passed by.\nPR: Why do you think he did that?\nYY: I learned that later, when the Khmer Rouge fall apart, when the Vietnamese took\nover the whole country, he said everybody in surrounding this area, the Khmer Rouge\nleaders told the people in the surrounding area that you don't have to talk to these people.\nIf you talk to these people, you have a connection with them, then you will be suspicious;\nyou will be spied by the Khmer Rouge.\nPR: Do you think he knew it was you when you - -\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: He did?\nYY: Later on, I met him, too. And I was so skinny, I was tending the water buffalo and\nhe was casting the net into the stream to catch the fish. And he didn't - - he just glare at\nhis rice pot, and I went there and got the rice. And then I got the rice and I walk away.\nPR: So you didn't talk because he was afraid of being associated with you?\nYY: Uh-huh.\nPR: Right?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: Eventually, did you hook up with your family again?\nYY: Yes, I went - - I think in April, 1979, and I hook up.\nPR: Where did you find them or how did you find them?\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nYY: When the Vietnamese came, I didn't realize the Vietnamese came, because I saw a\nlot of Khmer Rouge track. Khmer Rouge vehicle in a long procession. And I realize, of,\nmaybe something wrong with the Khmer Rouge government. And I didn't realize that the\nKhmer Rouge fall apart. I heard through the Khmer Rouge about fighting Vietnamese\nand asked all of us to join the military. And said they are known to us, well, if any want\nto be soldiers, come and join us. We can feed you, we provide plenty of food for you.\nAnd at that time, I didn't care. I said, well, I join. I said, you give me food.\nPR: Did you join?\nYY: No. Then just -- end of the meeting, we heard the tank, the tank moving, the tank\nsound shake the ground. The Khmer Rouge vehicle passed just, I think, for about ten\nminutes and then we heard the tank. Sound of the vehicle I think three day, four nights,\nsomething like that, pass. And I realize, oh, this is something wrong. The Khmer Rouge\nmust fall apart. The Khmer Rouge must fall apart. And then the Vietnamese tank came\nand they shoot at the Khmer Rouge and Khmer Rouge spread into the mountain, close to\nthe mountain at that point, and they ran to the mountain. And then the Vietnamese tank\nran up to them and shoot at them. And we got back and all of my teammates, the people\nwho are in my team, got together and I couldn't walk and we raid they call Economic\nCenter, Khmer Rouge Economic Center. That center have plenty of all kind of food: fish,\nrice, and tire. I think needle and sewing machine, the truck, the cow. All the livestock\nwere raised there. And we all ran into the cage and catch the duck and chicken, and we\nkill and make food. And we were there, we celebrate. We were there about 7 days, we\ndon't care when the Khmer come back and kill us. We didn't think about that. I did not\nthink about that at all.\nPR: Had the Khmer Rouge that were running your camp, had they taken off, had they\ngone?\nYY: They gone, they run away. When the tank - - the Khmer tank came. And I saw the\nKhmer Rouge throw away the bicycle and I told my friend, I want to get that bike, I want\nto get that bike. Maybe I can ride that bike to my village and we can celebrate. We are\nliberated and we survived again...\nPR: So you had this great huge party using up the Khmer Rouge storage camp?\nYY: Uh-huh.\nPR: Where did you take off for?\nYY: Then I stayed until I have enough strength, about seven days or more than seven\ndays. I have enough strength, and I am strong right now. Then we move. Then the\nVietnamese soldier come back from the top of the mountain with the tank and shoot and\nsaid, (dee, dee, dee, dee), and (dee) mean go, go. Then we pack and we move to - - and\nsay you go this way, this way, this way. And the Vietnamese soldiers pick you up if they\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nsee anybody who really good shape, (Pol Pot, Pol Pot), they say, (Pol Pot) ... and they\ncatch that person if anybody is good shape.\nPR: Looking good?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: So did you head out for your home village or go off to Thailand?\nYY: I head out for my home village for the first time. But on the way to my home village,\nI meet a guy and that guy came and I keep asking them is they know where my family\nlive, my family pass away or were killed. And I asked this guy all along the way because\nby that time some people who were liberated before us, perhaps late 1978, December,\n1978, they came to gather all the stock, all the stuff, they used the ox cart to carryall the\nrice. They took all the rice back to the village. And I keep asking those people who come\nto collect, to gather all the belongings. And then I met a guy, guy said, well, I know, I\nknow this guy. And I asked him, do you know this guy and then I asked about my father\nand where my home town is. Oh, I have a friend who used to live in Anokob village. And\nI said who is he, and he says, Muth. I said, oh, that is my third cousin. Where is he? He\nsays he is up there. He point to me, and come with us to collect all of the rice. I say can I\nsee him? When I walk to him, he didn't know who I was. And then I said, I am Mr. Yan\nson, and yom and (Seun Yan) son. I am Yoeuth. And said, oh. Then he know. And said, I\nknow, I can take you to your mom, because he didn't call my mom name. He call mom.\nSo I came with him to the village where my mom and my siblings stayed. And we were\nthere in that village for, I think, until late 1979. We head for refugee camp.\nPR: You all left together?\nYY: No, no. The first time, reason that I left Cambodia because my older brother, the one\ninside, in Thailand right now, he was accused of liberation force, liberation network,\nwhat you call Khmer freedom, Khmer liberation friend.\nPR: Uh-huh.\nYY: And he joined with that network and he was accused by his friend, who worked for\nVietnamese authorities, and my brother was arrested. And then this guy send my brother\nto Battambang jail. And my brother escaped from jail and they say, oh, we can come up\nto his brother's. So then the news spread to me right away that my brother was escaping\nand these people want to arrest me because I was a scapegoat. And they want to arrest\nme. And they told me, you have to leave. And my mom said, well, you have to leave\nthen. You don't have to stay with us.\nPR: So you went across the border to a camp in Thailand?\nYY: Yeah.\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nPR: From that camp you got to Minnesota, then?\nYY: No, I stayed in - - went back and forth, went back and forth. I went to they call old\ncamp, (Mak Moon camp) and then to kind of move around to (Nong Jamit camp) and\nthen move to -- I did not stay at (Nontang camp) very long, a few days a few nights. But I\nwas living in (Mak Moon) perhaps one year and then a new camp, Samit camp for - -\nPR: How were the conditions of the camp, camps?\nYY: Condition in the camps was not really good for me in the first time and I did not\nhave any money, any things to support my life. The first time, I have to, because there are\na lot of people come from Cambodia and get into Thailand buy goods from Thailand and\nsell to Cambodia. So then I not know what to do. And then I think, oh, my mom gave me\nsome gold. And then I sold that gold. I got about seven hundred baths and I said maybe I\ncan use this money to build my business. Perhaps I can get into Thai village and buy\nsome stuff and sell to these people. Then I keep thinking about that and then I practiced\nthat. And I went to a Thai village and bought the rice from a Thai village and sell it to\nCambodia and made profits. And my money keep getting more and more than. Then I\nkeep buying different goods from the lowest to the expensive bicycle, recorders, and I\nmake money until 19 - - I got shot by the Thai robber. I got shot on my back here. And\nthen my older brother in Thailand right now said you shouldn't do that anymore because\nit's very dangerous, because sometime people were killed by Thai robbers, and kill by\nThai soldiers. And some beat by the robbers, the gang bandit in Cambodia. So you don't\nhave to do that. Maybe you can stay in the camp with me.\nPR: Did you do that?\nYY: Yeah, I did that because –\nPR: So how did you get out of the camp into the United States?\nYY: I got married in 1980, and then I said I am not in that business anymore, and I\nworked with (ARC). I found a way. Then I speak a little bit of English at that time, so I\nlearned from this people American Refugee Committee ... make friend with (Jean\nJachman) and she help me to buy a book and stuff. And one day I learn about my brother-in-\nlaw. He wrote letter to my wife to, yeah, to my wife and to his older brother who is\nalso now in Minnesota. Oh, (Lon) is in Minnesota, at that time my older brother-in-law\nwas in (Khao I Dang) and my mother-in-law come back from Cambodia to visit us in the\ncamp. And accidentally my older brother-in-law came from (Khao I Dang) to visit us in\nthe camp and he met my wife and my mom, my mother-in-law. And then he talked to my\nmother-in-law and told my mother-in-law, oh, (Lon) is in Minnesota, United States. And\nI was approved by the INS - - I hope I can join him very soon and would you like to\ncome, would you please come. And my mother-in-law said, well, I have a youngest son\nin Cambodia, and also your dad in Cambodia. I have to go back to Cambodia and bring\nall these people. Then my mother-in-law went back to Cambodia and brought all of them\nand they got to (Khao I Dang) and then I followed them later. I came to (Khao I Dang) in\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\n1984, and about a month, we were recognized as legal refugees. And before that you have\nto sneak under ground, live like a squirrel, live like a frog in the well.\nPR: So, but you were then recognized as refugees in '84?\nYY: No, we just sneak into the camp and be illegal in (Khao I Dang).\nPR: Then how did you get the great kind of status to come to the United States?\nYY: Then in 1986, United Nation high commissioner for refugee in Thailand say these\npeople could be interviewed...high commission refugee and Thailand say that, oh...these\npeople could be if they have agreement with the United States also, I don't know - - these\npeople classified as refugees so they could be interviewed by United States and these\npeople have relatives in United States. And my brother-in-law here works so hard with\nSenator Rudy Boswitch and Senator Durenberger. And then he file a petition for us and\nthen we join them there.\nPR: Okay. Do you like it here?\nYY: Yeah.\nPR: Do you like the life here?\nYY: Yeah, I like very much.\nPR: Do you ever think that you would like to go back to Cambodia?\nYY: Well, to me, I have bad enough experience and now I am a citizen of United States.\nSo at some point I want to go back but not to live there, to visit my own people, to visit\nthe country.\nPR: Do you feel more or less at home here now then?\nYY: Yeah. I felt here is more like my home and Cambodia is my native country. But\nbecause my trip, just come back from Cambodia, so - -\nPR: You did?\nYY: Yeah. I just come back from Cambodia, so I feel like I am not safe to go back.\nPR: How do you find - - do you think things are not going well there, the U.N. has not\nbrought things under control?\nYY: Well, I have no comment on that.\nPR: Okay. But while you were there, you didn't feel completely safe, is that correct?\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society\nYY: Yeah, that's correct. Because everything is not set in good place, so. Everything is\nnot just - - even education is not there, sanitation is not there, social service is not there.\nAdministration is not there.\nPR: Do you have any idea what is going to happen to your family that is over there in\nThailand?\nYY: I hope they will join me very soon by the end of year because I file petition for them\nalready and they were approved by the regions INS in Nebraska. And I hope to be\ninterviewed by the end of this month, so I hope they will come to the United States very\nsoon.\nPR: I hope so, too, Yoeuth. I really do. Thank you so much for taking part in the Khmer\nArchives Project. I really appreciate your coming. I know talking about some of these\nthings is very hard, because it brings back some awful memories for you. But we do\nappreciate it very much.\nYY: Yes, that is my pleasure.\nPR: Bye, bye. That is it.\nKhmer Oral History Project\nMinnesota Historical Society"

Now the person who warned you was doing a brave thing,\\nwasn't he?\\nYY: Yeah. He warned me.

I left\\nwith the old lady because I, at the time, fortunately for me, there was a lady, old lady,\\ncame from a zone four to find her son. And her son was in the team, the same team that I\\nbelonged to. And she came to take her son back to \\\"zone four\\\". By that time, the head of\\nvillage said, well, now is time for you, its time for you, you can go with the lady and you\\ncan walk along with her and then when you get to zone four, you can go to your mom, to\\nfind your mom, because your mom is in zone four, but just different village.\\nPR: Now, what happened to your father?\\nYY: When I came back and when I met my mom, I think at night, because I came at\\nnight, and I, when I came - - when I left the village, on the way to the zone four, when I\\ncame across the highway five, there is a Cambodian - - we walk along highway five from\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nO'Kreart to Pray Sway, and then I saw the guy rode the bicycle from Prey Sway direction\\nand I look at this guy and say, oh, I know this guy, I know this guy. And I stop this guy.\\nAnd then I knew him right away and I asked Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang, do you know me?\\nAnd he said no. And I said, do you know Mr. Yom, and Seun. And he said, oh, yeah.\\nYour mom. Then he surprised and said, are you Yoeuth? And I said yes. And he said\\nyour mom live close to me. And I said, can I come with you to my mom, because I was\\non the way to zone four and I want to find my mom, but I have no idea. He said yes. Then\\nI didn't go along with the old lady and her son anymore, I come with this old man. And\\nthen when I got to my mom's village, I think around midnight, and then he knock at my\\nmom's shack and said Seun, Seun, I brought important stuff, thing, for you; good thing\\nfor you. Please light your lantern, light your lamp and wake all your children up and\\nprepare the meal also.

And he was taken away. And at one point, I can remember right now, he told my\\nmom that would you please take care of children because I know I was not coming back.\\nI know that.\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nPR: How long did you get to stay with your family?\\nYY: When I got back to my mom and I stay with my mom, because since that night,\\nvery, very heavy raining.

Fever and chill, and they gave me some Khmer Rouge medication. It looked like\\nrabbit excrement. So looked like rabbit excrement. So they gave me that medication and\\nthey gave me (Quinide) from China, a pink pill. I took that for seven days. And then I got\\nbetter and then my older brother was in youth mobile team and said, well, you should go\\nwith me. Don't have to wait until the Khmer Rouge told you to do, you can come with me\\nto work. Then I was with my brother for a couple months with his team, because my\\nbrother team was assigned to transport the rice from zone seven to zone four by boat\\nbecause full of water from zone four to zone seven. So I just sat on the boat and my\\nbrother and his team rowed the boat because I was real skinny by that time.\\nPR: So how long did you get to stay with the family and work with your brothers?\\nYY: I was with the family, with my mom about fourteen day, I believe.\\nPR: Then what happened to you?\\nYY: And then I was with my brother's team and then later on they said, oh, all the front\\nforce have to join with the zone four team, zone four team.

Later on, they say, well, some people who are sick, is not\\nreally sick, just pretend to be sick person. Then this people are not useful to \\\"anka\\\"; they\\nsaid the enemy of the \\\"anka\\\". We should get rid of these people. And one of my group\\nleaders came and told me that, well, you shouldn't stay home anymore when you can go\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nto the field, work every day. When you get fever and chill, you can stay - - you can sleep\\non the dike instead.\\nPR: Sleep on the dike?\\nYY: Yeah, and bring your blanket along.

Get up the same time, predawn, four in the morning or five\\no'clock in the morning, till sunset.\\nPR: Were the food rations about the same?\\nYY: The food ration about the same, about the same.\\nPR: Were the Khmer Rouge -- how did they treat the workers? That is, were they hard on\\nthem or did they treat them well?\\nYY: The Khmer Rouge never treat anybody well, except the parties or perhaps the people\\nin the group, the people who joined the team in the revolution. The people they call new\\npeople. Those people were treat harshly by the Khmer Rouge. Any place anybody go,\\nbecause the Khmer Rouge, sometimes the they use the whip, the Khmer Rouge team\\ncompany, team company leader, carried a whip with them most of the time. If anybody\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\ndid something wrong, not just - - not really big mistake, you know, like you goes to get a\\nshower and you just a little bit late, they would kick you and whip you.\\nPR: Were you ever whipped?\\nYY: Yeah. But I was not whipped at this time, but after, later on.\\nPR: How long did you work in that youth mobile team?\\nYY: I was with the youth mobile team, but first I was assigned to do farming and later on\\nI was assigned the fertilizer team. So I was assigned to fertilizer team, I believe, in 1977.\\nPR: You worked on that team for awhile. You mentioned that you ended up in a\\nconcentration camp. How did you end up in a concentration camp?\\nYY: When I was with the fertilizer team, I carries all the excrements of human beings\\nand make fertilizer. Cut the leaf of trees and mix together and all the maggots swimming\\naround. And we have bad smell every day. But you get used to, just do the job. And later\\non the Khmer leaders said, well, we need a team who really work hard who can help\\n\\\"anka\\\" zone four, and we need strong people who can carry the rice sacks. Then they\\npoint out to the people and the team. And say, oh, we need ten people who work really\\nhard who can carry the rice sack, because the rice sack is about eight kilogram for each\\nrice sack. And they look at me and they look at the other people. Because I carry, when I\\nwas with to the fertilizer team, I carry the excrement, human excrement, big gasoline can\\ncut into -- split into two -- and I carry that. And very, very heavy. And say, well, this\\ncomrade can carry the rice sack because he is really strong. And point, this one. And I\\nwas ... and then they sent me to the transportation team in zone four. I was with the\\ntransportation team about just a short period of time. Then the northwestern leader was\\naccused the enemy of the central party and they send the southwestern people to take\\nover the whole regions. And then when the northwestern people - - no, southwestern\\npeople, they call (Nearaday) came to take over the whole regions, then they say, oh, these\\npeople belong to the previous zone leader so we should move these people from this area.\\nThen told you have to get out of this area for awhile until we set the things smooth. We\\nput the thing in smooth transitional way, then we will take you back. But now we have to\\nsend you to this area to work for \\\"anka\\\". That is when I end up in concentration camp.\\nPR: So that is where they sent you was to a concentration camp?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nPR: What happened to you there in the concentration camp?\\nYY: When I got to that place, I didn't realize that I was in concentration camp because I\\nthought I was just youth mobile team. And I start realize when they carry weapon. The\\nKhmer leader carried a gun all the time to guard us anyplace we go. And they carry the\\nwhip all the time. And when we got there, they told us, now, you are not -- you cannot do\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nwhat you want to do, you are not youth mobile team anymore. Now you are in this camp.\\nYou need to be reeducated. This is reeducated camp.\\nPR: What did they do to you?\\nYY: Then they asked, I think four or five thousand, all of us, to dig the dam and build the\\nroad, dig the well, plant the rice, build the dike, build a stream, the water stream.\\nPR: So it was sort of more of the same, really?\\nYY: More of the same. But this camp, the soldiers, the Khmer Rouge soldiers guard us\\nall the time. And this really harsh, really harsh treatment from the Khmer Rouge at this\\ntime at the concentration camp. In the morning, you have to get up when the Khmer\\nRouge blew the whistle. You have to get up and then they order you to take a shower at\\n4:00 in the morning. And your body is not really sensitive to the waters because you are\\nvery skinny and you hardly walk. Young man like me, when I got up, I have to put my\\nhand on both knee to get up. And we barely walk. This camp, a lot of my friends were\\nkilled, a lot…one of my friend was (Phin Ngan), his name was (Phin Me). He was\\nLieutenant Governor son, Phin Ngan), Battambang Province.\\nYY: And others, two or three was former militia officer, also my friend also; my friend,\\ntoo. And those were killed, beaten to death on the rice field.\\nPR: Did you see that happen?\\nYY: I did not see what happened, but because, when I was in concentration camp, they\\nseparate me from the rest of my team, my former team. The Khmer Rouge came and\\npoint to everybody, and then they point at me, do you know how to plow the field? I said\\nyes. And, do you know how to tend the cattle, the ox, the buffalo, water buffalo? I said\\nyes, I can tend the oxen, but I am afraid I am not used to the water buffalo. Then the\\nKhmer Rouge leader says, well, you can do it. So then they picked me out from the team.\\nAnd then my friend, (Phin Ngan's) son, Lieutenant Governor son, his skin very light, was\\nreal light. And he was stayed there, he was not with me. And I was with another team,\\nwhat they call plowing team. Plowing harrow team.\\nPR: So did you learn about his death from somebody else that was there and saw it?\\nYY: Yes, because in day time we were in the front team, but at night we came to the\\nsame shack, we stayed in the same shack at night. So I learned when my friend was taken\\naway one night when I came back from plowing the field. One friend came to me, Mr.\\n(Meng), Comrade (Meng), Khmer Rouge called Comrade (Meng), came to me and said\\n(Phin Me) was taken away today and we don't know where. Since then, we never see\\nhim, you know, saw him. And later on Mr. (Doeun), our Comrade (Doeun) was not taken\\naway, he was beaten to death on the rice field with the head of the how.\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nPR: Know why?\\nYY: The head of the hoe.\\nPR: Do you know why he was beaten to death?\\nYY: He was carrying seedling rice for another team to plant on the field. And he tripped\\nhis leg and fall into the field, the farm field, and fall into the (seedling) the plants, the rice\\nplants, and broke a few rice plant. And the Khmer Rouge say that is the enemy.\\nPR: And they beat him. By doing that, he was an enemy, and beat him for that?\\nYY: Uh-huh.\\nPR: You were in the concentration camp for about a year?\\nYY: Yeah, I think about a year. And when I perform my job, I saw a lot of dead bodies in\\nthe farm field. Because run a harrow, my plow and my harrow, I can see the dead bodies\\nand flesh of dead bodies come out from the…\\nPR: The rice field?\\nYY: Yeah, the rice field. And some, I saw red water come out, red water. And then I saw\\nthe bone, the bone come out. And then I have to get off from the harrow and pick - - I\\nhave to pick up those bone and put on a small hill nearby. And I was with this team when\\nI tended the water buffalo in one the grass land, I saw the (club) of, (club) that the Khmer\\nRouge soldiers use to beat the people to death. And I saw the leg of people out of the\\nground, sticking out, and the clothes. And I was so shocked and I think maybe my friend\\nor somebody who was killed here. And the wolf came by and eat all those flesh.\\nPR: The animals?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nPR: Wild animals?\\nYY: Yeah, wild animals.\\nPR: How did you escape from the concentration camp?\\nYY: Until the Khmer Rouge took -- until the Vietnamese took over the whole country.\\nAnd this concentration camp, I was beaten by Khmer Rouge and here (indicating), my\\nscar on my left eyebrow, is a scar.\\nPR: Why did they beat you?\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nYY: One morning, they told me that when the whistle blew I have to get up and run and\\ndress up my clothes and run. I was a little bit late and the Khmer Rouge, when they blew\\nthe whistle, one Khmer Rouge blew the whistle and the others carried a whip along and\\nhit. Anybody that didn't have to get up and run. If you don't run, you are going to get\\nwhipped.\\nPR: And that is what happened to you?\\nYY: That is what happened to me.\\nPR: Do you have anything else -- do you have any other memories of the concentration\\ncamp that stand out in your mind?\\nYY: I have a lot of memories at this concentration camp. I was beaten and I saw the\\npeople were killed because a lot of my friends asked me to leave, to escape from this\\nconcentration camp. And some of them escaped safely. I met them by the time the\\nVietnamese took over the whole country. Some of them were not safe. One morning,\\nwhen we got up and then the Khmer Rouge announced by a loudspeaker, we caught the\\nenemy, we caught one enemy trying to escape from the “anka\\\"~. Would you please\\ngather around in front of young women center, women shack. And then everybody\\ngathered according to the order, and we came and the Khmer Rouge brought this guy, put\\nin front of everybody about three or four thousand people -- and then he chopped this guy\\nwith the knife. He opened the abdomen in front of a lot of people, a lot of youngsters.\\nAnd he pierced his knife into this guys eyes. And this guy scream in pain. And I can see.\\nAnd he, Khmer Rouge, kick on his head and twist him around.\\nPR: You know, you have described such terrible, horrible things and I can't help wanting\\nto ask you if, after awhile, when things are that bad, do you ever sort of get used to it to\\nthe point where it no longer horrifies you? Or did you -- was it always horrible to see\\nthese things happen? What I am asking is if you ever sort of got to the place where it was\\nso common to see horrible things that they no longer got to you?\\nYY: Some point, I feel, because I do not put my life in value anymore, I just say to\\nmyself, well, I just live from day-to-day. And maybe this day that is him, maybe\\ntomorrow that is me. And I don't care. I am not taking care of my body anymore. I just let\\nit go. If they take me, then that is my life, that is the end of my life.\\nPR: So the feeling was sort of like hopelessness?\\nYY: Hopeless, give up all the hope.\\nPR: Then when the Vietnamese came in in '79, and over-ran Cambodia and defeated the\\nKhmer Rouge, that is when you were liberated, sort of. I don't know if liberated is the\\nright word?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nPR: What happened, did everybody take off into the jungle or was it orderly or mad-house?\\nYY: I did not realize that the Vietnamese invade Cambodia. By the time that the\\nVietnamese came, I was sent to a jungle, to deep jungle. Up north, close to the mountain\\nthey call (Pahall), very far away from the first place, the first concentration place. And\\nwhen we got there, the people around the village, the people around that concentration\\ncamp were afraid to talk to us. They never came to us to talk to us at all. Even, I met my\\nsecond cousin, the one that I escaped from him in 1976 I met him. He came, he walked\\nby, I don't know, accidentally, I saw him. I said to him, (Dorn, Dorn); he didn't even look\\nat me. He just walked by. He passed away, he passed by.\\nPR: Why do you think he did that?\\nYY: I learned that later, when the Khmer Rouge fall apart, when the Vietnamese took\\nover the whole country, he said everybody in surrounding this area, the Khmer Rouge\\nleaders told the people in the surrounding area that you don't have to talk to these people.\\nIf you talk to these people, you have a connection with them, then you will be suspicious;\\nyou will be spied by the Khmer Rouge.\\nPR: Do you think he knew it was you when you - -\\nYY: Yeah.\\nPR: He did?\\nYY: Later on, I met him, too. And I was so skinny, I was tending the water buffalo and\\nhe was casting the net into the stream to catch the fish. And he didn't - - he just glare at\\nhis rice pot, and I went there and got the rice. And then I got the rice and I walk away.\\nPR: So you didn't talk because he was afraid of being associated with you?\\nYY: Uh-huh.\\nPR: Right?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nPR: Eventually, did you hook up with your family again?\\nYY: Yes, I went - - I think in April, 1979, and I hook up.\\nPR: Where did you find them or how did you find them?\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nYY: When the Vietnamese came, I didn't realize the Vietnamese came, because I saw a\\nlot of Khmer Rouge track. Khmer Rouge vehicle in a long procession. And I realize, of,\\nmaybe something wrong with the Khmer Rouge government. And I didn't realize that the\\nKhmer Rouge fall apart. I heard through the Khmer Rouge about fighting Vietnamese\\nand asked all of us to join the military. And said they are known to us, well, if any want\\nto be soldiers, come and join us. We can feed you, we provide plenty of food for you.\\nAnd at that time, I didn't care. I said, well, I join. I said, you give me food.\\nPR: Did you join?\\nYY: No. Then just -- end of the meeting, we heard the tank, the tank moving, the tank\\nsound shake the ground. The Khmer Rouge vehicle passed just, I think, for about ten\\nminutes and then we heard the tank. Sound of the vehicle I think three day, four nights,\\nsomething like that, pass. And I realize, oh, this is something wrong. The Khmer Rouge\\nmust fall apart. The Khmer Rouge must fall apart. And then the Vietnamese tank came\\nand they shoot at the Khmer Rouge and Khmer Rouge spread into the mountain, close to\\nthe mountain at that point, and they ran to the mountain. And then the Vietnamese tank\\nran up to them and shoot at them. And we got back and all of my teammates, the people\\nwho are in my team, got together and I couldn't walk and we raid they call Economic\\nCenter, Khmer Rouge Economic Center. That center have plenty of all kind of food: fish,\\nrice, and tire. I think needle and sewing machine, the truck, the cow. All the livestock\\nwere raised there. And we all ran into the cage and catch the duck and chicken, and we\\nkill and make food. And we were there, we celebrate. We were there about 7 days, we\\ndon't care when the Khmer come back and kill us. We didn't think about that. I did not\\nthink about that at all.\\nPR: Had the Khmer Rouge that were running your camp, had they taken off, had they\\ngone?\\nYY: They gone, they run away. When the tank - - the Khmer tank came. And I saw the\\nKhmer Rouge throw away the bicycle and I told my friend, I want to get that bike, I want\\nto get that bike. Maybe I can ride that bike to my village and we can celebrate. We are\\nliberated and we survived again...\\nPR: So you had this great huge party using up the Khmer Rouge storage camp?\\nYY: Uh-huh.\\nPR: Where did you take off for?\\nYY: Then I stayed until I have enough strength, about seven days or more than seven\\ndays. I have enough strength, and I am strong right now. Then we move. Then the\\nVietnamese soldier come back from the top of the mountain with the tank and shoot and\\nsaid, (dee, dee, dee, dee), and (dee) mean go, go. Then we pack and we move to - - and\\nsay you go this way, this way, this way. And the Vietnamese soldiers pick you up if they\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nsee anybody who really good shape, (Pol Pot, Pol Pot), they say, (Pol Pot) ... and they\\ncatch that person if anybody is good shape.\\nPR: Looking good?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nPR: So did you head out for your home village or go off to Thailand?\\nYY: I head out for my home village for the first time. But on the way to my home village,\\nI meet a guy and that guy came and I keep asking them is they know where my family\\nlive, my family pass away or were killed. And I asked this guy all along the way because\\nby that time some people who were liberated before us, perhaps late 1978, December,\\n1978, they came to gather all the stock, all the stuff, they used the ox cart to carryall the\\nrice. They took all the rice back to the village. And I keep asking those people who come\\nto collect, to gather all the belongings. And then I met a guy, guy said, well, I know, I\\nknow this guy. And I asked him, do you know this guy and then I asked about my father\\nand where my home town is. Oh, I have a friend who used to live in Anokob village. And\\nI said who is he, and he says, Muth. I said, oh, that is my third cousin. Where is he? He\\nsays he is up there. He point to me, and come with us to collect all of the rice. I say can I\\nsee him? When I walk to him, he didn't know who I was. And then I said, I am Mr. Yan\\nson, and yom and (Seun Yan) son. I am Yoeuth. And said, oh. Then he know. And said, I\\nknow, I can take you to your mom, because he didn't call my mom name. He call mom.\\nSo I came with him to the village where my mom and my siblings stayed. And we were\\nthere in that village for, I think, until late 1979. We head for refugee camp.\\nPR: You all left together?\\nYY: No, no. The first time, reason that I left Cambodia because my older brother, the one\\ninside, in Thailand right now, he was accused of liberation force, liberation network,\\nwhat you call Khmer freedom, Khmer liberation friend.\\nPR: Uh-huh.\\nYY: And he joined with that network and he was accused by his friend, who worked for\\nVietnamese authorities, and my brother was arrested. And then this guy send my brother\\nto Battambang jail. And my brother escaped from jail and they say, oh, we can come up\\nto his brother's. So then the news spread to me right away that my brother was escaping\\nand these people want to arrest me because I was a scapegoat. And they want to arrest\\nme. And they told me, you have to leave. And my mom said, well, you have to leave\\nthen. You don't have to stay with us.\\nPR: So you went across the border to a camp in Thailand?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nPR: From that camp you got to Minnesota, then?\\nYY: No, I stayed in - - went back and forth, went back and forth. I went to they call old\\ncamp, (Mak Moon camp) and then to kind of move around to (Nong Jamit camp) and\\nthen move to -- I did not stay at (Nontang camp) very long, a few days a few nights. But I\\nwas living in (Mak Moon) perhaps one year and then a new camp, Samit camp for - -\\nPR: How were the conditions of the camp, camps?\\nYY: Condition in the camps was not really good for me in the first time and I did not\\nhave any money, any things to support my life. The first time, I have to, because there are\\na lot of people come from Cambodia and get into Thailand buy goods from Thailand and\\nsell to Cambodia. So then I not know what to do. And then I think, oh, my mom gave me\\nsome gold. And then I sold that gold. I got about seven hundred baths and I said maybe I\\ncan use this money to build my business. Perhaps I can get into Thai village and buy\\nsome stuff and sell to these people. Then I keep thinking about that and then I practiced\\nthat. And I went to a Thai village and bought the rice from a Thai village and sell it to\\nCambodia and made profits. And my money keep getting more and more than. Then I\\nkeep buying different goods from the lowest to the expensive bicycle, recorders, and I\\nmake money until 19 - - I got shot by the Thai robber. I got shot on my back here. And\\nthen my older brother in Thailand right now said you shouldn't do that anymore because\\nit's very dangerous, because sometime people were killed by Thai robbers, and kill by\\nThai soldiers. And some beat by the robbers, the gang bandit in Cambodia. So you don't\\nhave to do that. Maybe you can stay in the camp with me.\\nPR: Did you do that?\\nYY: Yeah, I did that because –\\nPR: So how did you get out of the camp into the United States?\\nYY: I got married in 1980, and then I said I am not in that business anymore, and I\\nworked with (ARC). I found a way. Then I speak a little bit of English at that time, so I\\nlearned from this people American Refugee Committee ... make friend with (Jean\\nJachman) and she help me to buy a book and stuff. And one day I learn about my brother-in-\\nlaw. He wrote letter to my wife to, yeah, to my wife and to his older brother who is\\nalso now in Minnesota. Oh, (Lon) is in Minnesota, at that time my older brother-in-law\\nwas in (Khao I Dang) and my mother-in-law come back from Cambodia to visit us in the\\ncamp. And accidentally my older brother-in-law came from (Khao I Dang) to visit us in\\nthe camp and he met my wife and my mom, my mother-in-law. And then he talked to my\\nmother-in-law and told my mother-in-law, oh, (Lon) is in Minnesota, United States. And\\nI was approved by the INS - - I hope I can join him very soon and would you like to\\ncome, would you please come. And my mother-in-law said, well, I have a youngest son\\nin Cambodia, and also your dad in Cambodia. I have to go back to Cambodia and bring\\nall these people. Then my mother-in-law went back to Cambodia and brought all of them\\nand they got to (Khao I Dang) and then I followed them later. I came to (Khao I Dang) in\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\n1984, and about a month, we were recognized as legal refugees. And before that you have\\nto sneak under ground, live like a squirrel, live like a frog in the well.\\nPR: So, but you were then recognized as refugees in '84?\\nYY: No, we just sneak into the camp and be illegal in (Khao I Dang).\\nPR: Then how did you get the great kind of status to come to the United States?\\nYY: Then in 1986, United Nation high commissioner for refugee in Thailand say these\\npeople could be interviewed...high commission refugee and Thailand say that, oh...these\\npeople could be if they have agreement with the United States also, I don't know - - these\\npeople classified as refugees so they could be interviewed by United States and these\\npeople have relatives in United States. And my brother-in-law here works so hard with\\nSenator Rudy Boswitch and Senator Durenberger. And then he file a petition for us and\\nthen we join them there.\\nPR: Okay. Do you like it here?\\nYY: Yeah.\\nPR: Do you like the life here?\\nYY: Yeah, I like very much.\\nPR: Do you ever think that you would like to go back to Cambodia?\\nYY: Well, to me, I have bad enough experience and now I am a citizen of United States.\\nSo at some point I want to go back but not to live there, to visit my own people, to visit\\nthe country.\\nPR: Do you feel more or less at home here now then?\\nYY: Yeah. I felt here is more like my home and Cambodia is my native country. But\\nbecause my trip, just come back from Cambodia, so - -\\nPR: You did?\\nYY: Yeah. I just come back from Cambodia, so I feel like I am not safe to go back.\\nPR: How do you find - - do you think things are not going well there, the U.N. has not\\nbrought things under control?\\nYY: Well, I have no comment on that.\\nPR: Okay. But while you were there, you didn't feel completely safe, is that correct?\\nKhmer Oral History Project\\nMinnesota Historical Society\\nYY: Yeah, that's correct. Because everything is not set in good place, so. Everything is\\nnot just - - even education is not there, sanitation is not there, social service is not there.\\nAdministration is not there.\\nPR: Do you have any idea what is going to happen to your family that is over there in\\nThailand?\\nYY: I hope they will join me very soon by the end of year because I file petition for them\\nalready and they were approved by the regions INS in Nebraska.
