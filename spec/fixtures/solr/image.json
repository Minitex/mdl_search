'\nWe have 2 court appearances this week, with Tom Marthaler coming up on\nTuesday, November 7th in St0 Cloud and the Delano 20 starting their trial in\nBuffalo on Wednesday, November 8th,\nTom's appearing on the charge of, and are you ready for this, \"Possession of Illegal Police Monitoring Equipment\", stemming from an incident last\nJuly 8th v/hen he was rudely interrupted at work by a bunch of laWenforcement\ntypes. Proceedings.will start at id::06am«\nThen there's the Delano 20. In case you haven't been following this\nseries of events, it's gone something like this...\nLast Monday, October 30th, the 19 people arrested at Delano\" (having already begun their hunger strike) were arraigned in Buffalo** (Our 15 year old\nfreedom fighter, who v/as also arrested, was released on'Sunday). Bail v/as\nset at $500 for 15 and $1000 for the %  others. The reasoning of the prosecutor was that two of the people-were from out of state (evon though one wasn't)\nand that the other 2 were \"leaders\" and had \"promised them that it was going\nto be a peaceful demonstration and had lied.\" Well, needless to say, everyone decided to stay in and protest the excessive bail.\nOn Tuesday, Lawyer Ken Tillsen from the Legal Defense/Offense Comiiu went\nto Buffalo with about 30 folks from the cities and 7 or so from out our Waya\nKen got the bail lowered to \"'300 for everyone and also arranged for one Wright-\nCo, resident v/ho was busted to get PCR„ By this time many organizations were\ncalling in and offering to put up bail, so the decision was made that 8 of\nthe remaining 18 v/ho had job committments and the like, would bail out and\nthe remaining 10 would stay in until they.either got P«R. or went to trial.\nUnder the law, you can only hold people for so long before they are entitled\nto a speedy trial within 10 daysv\nSo, starting Wednesday morning the Delano 20 v/ill be stating their case\nin front of a jury. The minor who was arrested will be receiving a court\ndate soon for juvenile proceedings. More on the Delano 20 later.\nThe other item on Court Capers this week concerns folks with indictments,.\nSome of the \"indictees\" have had their bail returned in the last week. If\nyou've had your bail returned or are wondering where it is, call Deborah Pick\nat 283-5428. Other than that, lawyers have been set up to cover all the indictment cases and we're just sitting tight till v/e hear from Tom Thumb.\nComing upj_ The Villard 3's omnibus hearing on December 5th,\n**********************\n# There will be a meeting in Belle Plaine\n*\n*\n# Nov. 16th at 8:00pm being sponsored by #\n# a group of protesting farmers called   #\n# the Landowners-Association. It will be  t\nheld at the same locale as the last.mtng\nand everyone is.welcome to come and\nshow their support.\n*\n*\n* *\nIHAT GOES UK. .MUST COME DOWN\nTraverse and Grant are losing insulators, Pope is getting imported cops on\nthe weekends, Stearns and Meeker'have condemnation hearings with their commissioners coming up and Wright Co. jail is getting cables from Paris and\nBerlin! But the big thing again.this week is people having trouble with T.V.'\nradios, and phones as v/e11 as with their health when the line is juiced. So\nlet's keep phoning in those complaints to:\n1) Your local telephone company.\n2) Rey Rahko, -project coordinator UPA, 441-312i»\n3) KCMT ToV., 766-5166,\n4) 800-442-3013oC.the powerline HOTLINE.",
