It’s February 19, 2019, and I’m at the Continuing Legal Education Center [Minnesota CLE Conference Center, 600 Nicollet Mall #370, Minneapolis, MN] in\nMinneapolis [Minneapolis, MN] to interview retired Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page [Alan Cedric Page (August 7, 1945-)] for the Minnesota Supreme Court Oral History Project. The project is sponsored by the Minnesota Supreme Court Historical Society and its Preservation Committee in cooperation with the Minnesota State Law Library [Minnesota State Law Library, 25 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, St Paul, MN]. My name is Jeff Holth. I’m a practicing attorney here in Minnesota and I clerked for Justice Page from 2012 to 2013 and I’ll be conducting the interview today.\nThank you for coming today, Justice Page, and for agreeing to share your experiences and insights on your years on the court.\nAP: Well, thank you for inviting me and hopefully we can have a fun conversation.\nJH: Agreed. So let’s jump right in. I know you graduated from law school in around 1978 and served on the Supreme Court from ’93 [1993] to 2015, but I want to start by asking you about your earlier life before we talk about your years on the court.\nAP: Sure.\nJH: So I wonder if you could just start us off by talking a little bit about your family and where you grew up.\nAP: I was born in Canton, Ohio. I was the fourth of four children. My mother was a—worked as an attendant in a country club and my father, various jobs from operating juke boxes to running a bar—that sort of thing. As I say, I was the fourth of four children, two sisters and a brother. My childhood was a pretty happy one, pretty uneventful, not much exciting to talk about. We weren’t the wealthiest of families, but we weren’t the poorest either.\n3\nMy parents, neither one had the opportunity to go to school beyond high school and they emphasized for me and my brother and my sisters, the importance of education and the importance of being good citizens. And in their own way, something that, I think, stuck with me, they talked about and emphasized the importance of seeking excellence. Now they didn’t say it that way, but I think that’s the bottom line of what they were talking about. They would always—and I can hear them now telling me, Whatever you do in life, do it as well as you can. You’re going to be a garbage collector, be the best garbage collector you can be. If you’re going to be a doctor, be the best doctor you can be. Not as good as the next doctor or garbage collector, but the best one you can be. And that’s something that they preached and, I think, has served me well over time.\nJH: I think I recall you talking about, you know, at a pretty young age, having some experiences or influences that sort of made you think you might want to be a lawyer someday. Can you talk about that a little bit?\nAP: I very early on, you know, when I was eight, nine, ten years old, people would ask me what I wanted to do when I grew up and I would say I wanted to be a lawyer. And, you know, what eight-year-old knows really what they want to do when they grow up? But, as I noted, I grew up in Canton, Ohio. It was a town built on heavy industry, primarily steel, and I had an uncle who spent forty years working in the steel mill. And I knew intuitively that that’s not something that I wanted to do. Nothing wrong with working in steel mills, but from my eight-\n00:05:00 year-old eyes, the work was dirty; it was hard; it was dangerous and repetitious. And\nsomehow I knew that that didn’t fit me.\nI’d heard stories about lawyers, that, you know, from—not that I knew any lawyers, or had any lawyers in my family or my family really knew any lawyers, but the impression in the community I grew up was that lawyers didn’t work too hard; made lots of money; drove big, fancy cars; lived in big houses and went out and played golf every Wednesday afternoon. But for the eight-year-old mind balancing fancy cars and dangerous and dirty work—\nJH: Which do I choose?\nAP: Which do I choose? It becomes real simple. I also grew up watching Perry Mason [Perry Mason, CBS television from September 21, 1957, to May 22, 1966], and so I had a very rudimentary sense of what the law was about from that television show and finally, and something that influenced me greatly. You have to remember that I grew up—I was eight years old in 1954. At the time our country was grounded in state sponsored segregation and in 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown versus the Board of Education[of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483] and I can remember reading newspaper stories about it; hearing people talk about it; and again, not that I understood it fully, but it gave me a sense of the power that the law has. That if the courts, through the law, could essentially sound the death knell for state sponsored segregation, it had the power to change how people treat one another. And that’s something that I grew up [with] and had an interest in.\nAs I got older, I was disabused of the idea that lawyers didn’t work hard (laughter) or that they necessarily made lots and lots of money, but I also developed the sense that the law was 4\nabout solving problems and helping people and that’s also something that resonated with me. And so that was sort of my dream for the future. And never lost it, never lost it. And, again, you know, 1954 there was Brown. Along the way there were—there was Little Rock [Little Rock, AR]; there was Birmingham [Birmingham, AL]; there were full blown civil rights movements, an effort to change or address issues of race in ways that hadn’t been successful in the past. And, I’m sure that all had some bearing on my sense of what the law was about and what could be done with the law.\nJH: You know, thinking about Brown v. Board, specifically, do you, I mean, what was Canton like growing up sort of in terms of a racial makeup? Was it a pretty segregated, in fact, city?\nAP: Absolutely. Absolutely. You knew where you belonged and didn’t belong and it’s interesting. I didn’t grow up in an area where the segregation was state sponsored, but in practical effect, it might as well have been.\n00:10:00 JH: So let’s talk briefly about Central Catholic High School, your high school experience\nin Canton. Was it the plan for you to attend Central Catholic because your family did or was it football related, or what was the trajectory there?\nAP: Well, our family moved from Canton out into the countryside with an East Canton, Ohio, address because my parents felt that the education available in the Canton city schools wasn’t what they wanted for us. And my two older sisters, interestingly, didn’t decide to go to school in East Canton. They, and along with my parents, concluded that Canton Central Catholic had the best possible education for our circumstances. And so they ended up going to Central Catholic. And then, my brother, who was ahead of me, he went and so, I was destined to follow.\nAnd I—before I got to high school, I hadn’t really—I wasn’t much of an athlete as a kid; I wasn’t one of those kids that everybody sort of sought after to come and be on their team, but my brother went out for football and so when I got there, I went out and it, as it turns out, I evidently had some aptitude for it.\nJH: I’ve heard you use that phrase, “Have some aptitude for it,” before, yeah. So what do you, in terms of high school, do you remember having an early interest in sort of the law and politics and those sort of things or were you still sort of navigating and not quite sure—?\nAP: I think I was always interested in politics from very early on. But only in the sense of trying to figure out how it works to help people. I never had much interest in politics for politics’ sake. And so when I got to high school, I mean, I—the courses I loved were, you know, back then it was civics and government—those kind of classes.\nJH: So was there a point—so you played football at Central Catholic and is there a point, even in high school, where you think that football could be used as a way to pursue an education or does that realization not happen until a little bit later or—?\n5\nAP: You know, growing up in Canton, there was this conflict between athletics and academics. There was a very strong emphasis on athletics, particularly in the African-American community and so I’m growing up not much interested in football and seeing an inordinate number of young men who had—I guess what you would call stellar high school football careers—go off to college for two, three, four years, come back to Canton, ended up hanging out on the street corner, unemployed and unemployable. And, you know, that didn’t make sense to me. I couldn’t figure out—this was before I started playing football. Then I started playing, as I said, more by accident than by design and I loved playing but I was just playing football because I loved it and not for any other purpose.\n00:15:00 By the time I was a, you know, sophomore/junior, there was talk that I might be able to obtain\nan athletic scholarship and so I suppose around that time I started thinking about [how] it could be used. One of the, in hindsight, one of the disappointments when I look back is that while I did okay as a student in high school; did okay as a student in elementary and junior high school; I did it the easy way. I didn’t, essentially I wasn’t there to learn how to learn. I was there to do the work and I could do the work without learning how to learn. I could, you know, answer the questions and work through the math problems and all of that but simply because you can do the work, doesn’t mean that you’re really learning a whole lot because, I think, the important part of what goes on in schools in the education process is learning how to learn and so I sort of missed that.\nAnd so as, in high school, the work got more difficult, I still, you know, thrived to some degree, but had I learned how to learn early on, I think, I mean, I was focused on going to school beyond high school because that was the emphasis my parents placed, but if I had sort of made that connection to learning how to learn early on, I might have had a little more success academically and not, I don’t focus on that so much because, you know, I could have been—done better in school—but I would have been better prepared for the future.\nAs it turned out, I did okay, and ended up receiving a number of scholarship offers, athletic scholarship offers. I think had I had that—had I learned how to learn—there might have been some academic scholarships in that queue also, which gives you choices, right?\nJH: Sure.\nAP: But I had the opportunity to choose among some pretty good schools and ultimately selected the University of Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN].\nJH: That’s a good transition to Notre Dame and talk a little bit about your time in college. Why Notre Dame?\nAP: Primarily because of its academic reputation and because of its reputation in terms of how it interacted with its alumni. They have an incredible, had then, and continue to have, an incredible alumni association which provides any number of benefits to people who graduate\n00:20:00 from there in terms of employment opportunities and other kinds of support. And, you know,\nas I say, the schools that I was choosing from, they were all good schools. I mean, it was Purdue [Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN]; it was Michigan State 6\n[Michigan State University, 220 Trowbridge Road, East Lansing, MI]; it was Michigan [University of Michigan, 500 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI]; Minnesota [University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN]; Ohio State [Ohio State University, Columbus, OH]. So it wasn’t like they didn’t have some of the things that Notre Dame had to offer. But it was sort of looking beyond the college years that was, I think, ultimately the deciding factor.\nThat, coupled with, I had no interest in going to Ohio State, who knows why? And Notre Dame also had this reputation, football wise, that, at least at the time, was about as good as it got, you know, to a black kid from Canton, Ohio, going to play in the house that Knute Rockne [Knute Kenneth Rockne (March 4, 1888–March 31, 1931)] built, that sort of put stars in your eyes for sure.\nJH: So was that an exciting time I would suspect in a lot of ways? Was it a nerve wracking time transitioning from Canton and leaving home, or—?\nAP: It was an exciting time; a very difficult time. I, you know, just going back to Central Catholic, I was one of two, I think, maybe three; maybe four; African-American kids in my graduating class. Going off to Notre Dame it was going to be, you know, there were a few more, but not many more so—and it was at a time that sort of our national economy was sort of in a downward spiral and Notre Dame is in South Bend, Indiana, and they were also a heavy industry town and one of the main employers there was Studebaker, the auto manufacturer, and they went out of business just about the time I got there. It was my first time away from home really. I’d not been a kid who’d gone off to camp and spent any time away from home so it was all new to me. And it was also, you know, the first time that I’d really been put in a position where I was responsible for myself as every kid who goes off to school is.\nJH: Sure, that’s a big change.\nAP: A huge change. And so it was difficult. And one of the things I didn’t realize was Notre Dame was not the most progressive place to go to school and so that was something that was a little different for me and having to adjust to that. There were some difficult transitions.\nJH: Speaking to kind of the economy, in a downturn, thinking about that time, too, and in a lot of ways the civil rights movement is sort of at its apex and the Voting Rights Act and so was that a part of the campus conversation or do you recall anything about that?\n00:25:00 AP: Not much, a little bit, but not much. You know, and being on the football team there,\nyou really weren’t necessarily that much a part of the campus conversation, even though we were—we lived in the dorms with everybody else and went to meals with everybody else and went to classes with everybody else, your focal point was football and so you weren’t really much connected.\nAnd it was really kind of an interesting time in that respect because, I mean, the civil rights movement was going through some challenging times. About the same time, the Vietnam War protests started and so it’s sort of like you’re in this bubble looking out on all of this and not 7\nhaving a direct connection to it but having the opportunity to at least see it and think about it but not engage.\nJH: Well, it’s interesting you mention that because yeah, in thinking about it, the focus on football and you’re a young kid still and transitioning so maybe not a lot of capacity for a lot of other stuff when that’s the focus in a lot of ways.\nAP: Even if you had the instinct, they took up your time and your energy, both physical and emotional. And so it was, in that respect, I missed out on a lot but, you know, I can’t remember the precise timing, but my freshman year, the start of my freshman year, went to football training camp a couple of weeks before school started and I think we got there either just before or just after the March on Washington [The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 1963]. I think school had started by the time the bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church [The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. September 15, 1963), Birmingham, AL] had occurred in Birmingham. And so you had all of these things going on. As I noted, you’re sort of watching from afar. And understanding that they affect you, but sort of not directly.\nJH: Removed a little bit or, yeah. Well, the focus on football bore some fruit. National championship—was it your senior year?\nAP: Yes. I should note, I think it was in the—I think it was still while I was there or he was planning to come, one of our speakers, one of the people who was coming to campus to speak was George Wallace [George Corley Wallace Jr. (August 25, 1919–September 13, 1998)]. That got people engaged.\nJH: That got some attention?\nAP: That got some attention.\nJH: Did he come? Do you remember?\nAP: I’m pretty sure it was while I was still there. Needless to say, I didn’t attend.\nJH: Yeah, probably not a regret.\nAP: No.\nJH: So, you’re drafted by the Vikings kind of at the close of your career at Notre Dame and kind of moving ahead a little bit, there’s obviously lots to talk about that we could talk\n00:30:00 about with respect to your professional career in the NFL and—\nAP: It happened.\nJH: It happened. It happened. You’ve talked about it a little bit, right? But I want to focus on just kind of one unique aspect that I was interested about was your participation in the NFL 8\nPlayers Association. It’s something that I, you know, I’ve—I know you’ve talked about it before but we don’t hear that quite as often so I was just curious. You’re playing with the Vikings. How do you get involved in the Players Association and what’s sort of your role?\nAP: Well, there had been—this is a long, complicated story, too long and too complicated for here.\nJH: It’s a big question.\nAP: There had been various efforts on the part of players to organize before 1968. Nineteen sixty the league is confronted with another football league, the American Football League. In 1966, those two leagues merge with the merger taking place in ’68 and in 1968, the players from both leagues come together and form the National Football League Players Association. That was my second year in the league and somehow I either volunteered or agreed to serve as player representative. So that’s how I got involved.\nAnd, growing up in Canton, I was used to organized labor and had sort of a sense of what it was about and the other piece of it was that the reason players wanted to come together to form a union was because—well, there are a whole host of them, not the least of which is players essentially had no rights in terms of where they could play; very little ability to impact how much they were paid and then there were all these what I will call silly little rules that were imposed, I suppose, as a matter of control. That’s all I can think of. Things like you can’t have a beard or a mustache. I guess you could have a mustache but you couldn’t have a beard. Things like, you know, you have to be at every meal whether you want to eat or not. You have to—you can’t have a telephone in your room and this was before, you know, mobile phones, but you couldn’t have the telephone company put a phone in your room during training camp. I mean, those are just a couple that come to mind.\nAnd so there were really lots of limitations on a player’s ability to be themselves and players wanted to change that and obviously, the ability to choose where you worked would have an\n00:35:00 impact on how much you were paid. And so, I think for me, at least in the beginning, it was\nsort of all those little controls that just drove me crazy, that got me involved. And, you know, once you—you can’t get just a little bit wet once you’re into the pool you get all wet.\nJH: Did you enjoy it?\nAP: I loved it. It was frustrating at times but I think we laid the groundwork for the freedom that players have today. We laid the groundwork for players getting a fair share of the revenue. We laid the groundwork that allowed players to be treated like human beings as opposed to, in some sense, property. And along the way, I got to meet, know and work with a bunch of great lawyers. Leonard Lindquist [Leonard Lindquist (September 5, 1912-September 10, 2004)]; Gene Keating [Eugene Henry Keating (January 2, 1932-April 6, 2005)]; Ed Glennon [Edward M. Glennon (1924-April 24, 2009)]; Ed Garvey [Edward R. Garvey (April 18, 1940–February 22, 2017)]. I got to see from the inside what the law was all about and what good lawyering looks like.\n9\nJH: So is it fair to say that that was an influence on the decision to pursue a career?\nAP: That just confirmed—\nJH: That it was something you wanted to do.\nAP: That it was something I wanted to do. I enrolled at William Mitchell [now Mitchell Hamline School of Law, 875 Summit Avenue, St. Paul, MN] in the fall of 1968. I started my second year the league and it was not pretty.\nJH: Why not?\nAP: Well, you know, you get that assignment over the summer and there are like five hundred pages to read and you try to read it and none of it makes sense and you show up the first day and I don’t remember what the class was, but the professor could just as well be talking Greek as English. And, you think, I don’t understand what’s happening here because it’s a different process; at least it was a different process from what my undergraduate degree was like. And I was not ready for it.\nJH: Was it—well, you said you were second year in the league, playing and so was it—I mean, I’d suspect that obviously that has—playing is a lot of—the time commitment in and of itself so was it that you weren’t quite ready? Not enough time? Or did it—?\nAP: It wasn’t that. It was being confronted with being in this class and listening to these lectures that had no context.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And therefore made no sense. And, you know, it’s early on in the process so you don’t know how it all fits together.\nJH: New language.\nAP: New language, all of it. And I just—it was not pretty. (laughter)\nJH: Well, but it must not have—but it didn’t dissuade you, obviously, completely.\nAP: I say only half in jest, I knew after three days that I wasn’t going to survive, but I was in so far over my head that it took me another three and a half, three weeks to figure out how to drop out, to get out. And I—what I came to understand was, first of all, that I wasn’t alone.\n00:40:00 I mean, I’m sitting there thinking, I’m the only one that doesn’t get this. I’m the only one that\ndoesn’t understand this. But, you know, everybody in the room was in the same boat that I was. Had I—maybe had I not been playing football at the time, I’d have sort of stuck it out, but I mean, I was so far in over my head, I mean, I just couldn’t see—\n10\nJH: The path.\nAP: The path.\nJH: Yep, overwhelming.\nAP: And so, I bailed. But didn’t necessarily give up the hope or the idea. Over the years I tried one or two other career options. I was a used car salesman or actually a new/used car salesman. I sold one car during my auto sales experience.\nJH: I did not know that, that you tried that.\nAP: And the one car I sold to myself. (laughter) So I figured there was no career in that. I had a vending machine company for about a year and half. It took me—I invested about forty thousand dollars into it and it took me about a year and a half to go through that, although that was one of the—actually not one of—the best investment I ever made and we’ll get to that later, but one of the things I was learning was business, being in business, was not something that fit me; not something that interested me; not something that I wanted to put the time and energy and effort into becoming good at, which was a good lesson to learn. And ultimately, after my eighth year with the Vikings, I decided to go back to law school; this time having a better understanding, having been involved in, as a players’ rep, and then ultimately on the executive committee of the Players Association; been involved in a number of lawsuits involving the Players Association and the National Football League.\nStill, having the opportunity to see even more deeply how lawyers work, the way they thought, developing a sense for that and having the opportunity to talk with them and sort of learn that law school is just like that and that the secret to it is to endure. And at some point it starts to make sense. So after my eighth year I decided to go back. This time enrolled at the University of Minnesota and actually started the summer of 1975 at the University of Texas in Austin [Austin, TX]. I took contracts and procedures, thirteen weeks start to finish.\nJH: Wow!\nAP: And survived it.\nJH: There you go.\nAP: Not only survived it; loved every minute of it.\nJH: Confidence booster?\nAP: Big confidence booster.\nJH: Absolutely.\n11\nAP: Big confidence booster. Learned, you know, a little bit of the process of, remember how I talked about having failed to learn how to learn?\nJH: Exactly.\nAP: Took me to law school to get it.\nJH: Sometimes I wonder if it takes a lot of people up until that point. In some ways, I sort\n00:45:00 of felt the same way.\nAP: Well, but once I got it—\nJH: Yeah.\nAP: there’s nothing else like it.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And so I loved the law school experience. People, you know, are always talking about, Well, you went to law school and played professional football—how hard that must have been. Yeah, things are hard but when you’re having fun, there’s nothing better. I mean, I loved my law school experience at the university.\nAnd I had another one of those defining moments and I think it was towards the end of my first year. We had a paper to write and I decided I was going to, you know, take the easy road, something you know about, labor, labor law. And actually I think I wrote something on labor relations in the NFL. But I, you know, I spent all this time doing the research and preparing and I just—nothing happened. And I can remember going in to see one of the associate or assistant deans and saying, I don’t know that I can do this. And he said, Well, you can do it. All you have to do is apply yourself. And I think, What have I been doing?\nJH: Well, that clears it up, right?\nAP: Right. And he said, No, you apply the seat of your pants to the chair until you get it, until it starts coming and, you know, it’s weird but, you know, I sat down, got my books and my pens and my papers and sat there and eventually started writing and got it done. And that was an important lesson—that sometimes even when you know what you want to do, but it’s not coming together, you have to just keep working at it until it happens.\nJH: This is jumping ahead a little bit so we’ll have to swing back but that makes me think about the process of sitting down and writing an opinion a little bit, too. Is there a similarity there, too? The process of just needing to sit down and sort of delve in to get it started and once it’s started, flows a little bit?\nAP: It flows. Absolutely.\n12\nJH: Interesting. So law school at U of M. I was going to ask you and I think you really answered it was, you know, by the time you do go to the U of M, you’re still playing; raising a family; not like there aren’t any other things going on. You’re busy but you manage it by—\nAP: But then it’s just a matter of time management.\nJH: Sure.\nAP: And figuring out how to, you know, make it all work, putting all the pieces together. And I mean, I did have some incentive. I mean, by then I was twelve years into my professional career. You don’t play forever and quite frankly, I didn’t want to necessarily play forever. As I’ve said often, by the time I started law school, I’d been playing for—I was into my ninth year and I hadn’t done everything you could do on a football field but I’d done most of them and I noted earlier, repetition wasn’t one of my strong suits. It was time to prepare to do something different so that I could move on. As I’ve often said, you know, the skills of a defensive tackle don’t transfer to much of anything else out in the real world and so preparing\n00:50:00 to do something beyond football was really important. And law school was that preparation.\nJH: Right. So you graduate from law school and you graduate and —you graduate and—what’s the timing there? You still play for a little bit after you graduate?\nAP: I played three and a half more years.\nJH: Three and a half more years and so you’re—\nAP: Seventy-eight; seventy-nine [1979]. Four more years.\nJH: Okay. During that time, then, you graduate, you’re playing, but then you start at Lindquist and Vennum [Lindquist \u0026 Vennum, offices in Minnesota, Colorado, and South Dakota; formed in 1968 when Lindquist, Magnuson \u0026 Glennon combined with Vennum, Newhall, Ackman \u0026 Goetz. As of January 1, 2018, the firm merged with and took the name of Ballard Spahr]. So what’s the practice there like? Tell me about that a little bit.\nAP: It’s trying to figure out who you are as a lawyer. And it’s, you know, getting assignments and, you know, Here’s the file. Go do this. And it’s like, How do you go do this? (laughter)\nJH: A little more explanation.\nAP: Would be helpful. It wasn’t always forthcoming. Sort of get thrown into the thick of things and there were some horrible, awful, very bad moments where I had no idea what I was doing but had to try to figure it out while I was doing it.\nJH: Enjoyable though?\nAP: Not especially. 13\nJH: No?\nAP: One of the things I figured out early on about the private practice of law, it’s about business; it’s about billing hours and that just—it never—that is not me. My interest in the law was the law and trying to sort of work through it, sort it out and figure it out and come to the best conclusions that you can. And when you’ve got this little thing sitting on your shoulder talking about billable hours, first of all, you’re distracted by that because you’re thinking, Hey, am I billing enough hours and how do I justify these hours? And so from that standpoint, it was not necessarily pleasant.\nThat said, I got to work with some really good lawyers and like every other new lawyer, Can you do a memo for me on this? And you give them the memo and it comes back and it’s like, I didn’t know there was that much red ink in the world. (laughter)\nJH: But lessons, then, as well, I suppose, too, right, so you’re—\nAP: Absolutely.\nJH: it’s a big learning curve but you’re learning a lot.\nAP: But you’re learning a lot. That’s where I got grounded and so from that standpoint, it was a very valuable experience but just not my idea of a good time. And I was fortunate enough to make my way to the attorney general’s office and I loved it there because Skip Humphrey [Hubert Horatio \"Skip\" Humphrey III (June 26, 1942-)] was the attorney general and he let the lawyers who were there to do the work, do the work. And let me learn to give my best legal advice to my clients. Didn’t have to worry about billing hours; didn’t have to worry about clients walking away. I could do the best that I could to figure out what is the best—what is the law and what is the best advice I can give this client? And I could do that and there’s a lot of freedom in that and I absolutely loved it.\n00:55:00 JH: Did you have a particular focus in the attorney general’s office?\nAP: Labor and employment.\nJH: You were? Okay.\nAP: Labor and employment.\nJH: And you enjoyed that?\nAP: And that’s what I did at Lindquist also on the employee side and just flipped to the employer side.\nJH: So you’re working at the Minnesota Attorney General’s office four years, five years-ish, something like that? 14\nAP: Started in ’85, the first week of January, 1985, and left the last week of December in 1992.\nJH: Okay, so, yeah. So when do you start thinking about—maybe not even necessarily the Minnesota Supreme Court but the idea of doing something different and maybe that being judging?\nAP: You know, I had this weird experience. In 1982, I’m at Lindquist and Vennum and—’82 or ’83—and I wake up one morning and the newspaper has an article about Governor Perpich [Rudolph George Perpich Sr. (June 27, 1928–September 21, 1995)] is going to appoint some new judges and he’s got my name on the list. Nobody had asked.\nJH: Interesting.\nAP: It was very strange but up until that point it hadn’t really occurred to me a) that I would have the interest in being a judge or that I could be, or that I had the skills or temperament. Long story short, made me think about it. And, you know, through that time, I’m learning who I am as a lawyer; what my skills are; what my interests are; and what my strengths and weaknesses are. And over time, I sort of start thinking, Maybe there is something in the judiciary that would fit me, but I can’t see myself necessarily as a trial court judge. And, you know, as lawyers we spend a lot of time reading opinions and struggling to figure out what they mean. And thinking, Well, if they meant this, why didn’t they just say it? Why is it so hard to say in plain clear language what you mean?\nAnd of course, my ego says to myself, Self, you could do that. You could write clearly. You could write concisely and so over time I start to think my skills and my interests, my abilities, my strengths lend themselves to what appellate court judges do. And from there, well, how does one become an appellate court judge? Well, as you know in Minnesota, it’s either by appointment or by election. And the Minnesota Court of Appeals is new, relatively new, and most of the judges there or many of the judges there had been trial court judges, so that seems like a natural step even though the trial court isn’t necessarily what fits me. And so I started applying for trial court judge positions and had absolutely no success.\n01:00:00 Eventually I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t going to have any success and that, if I\nwanted the opportunity to serve, it was probably going to be through election, which narrows things down to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And my thought process was, Well, if you’re going to seek election, you might as well seek election to the Minnesota Supreme Court. I think I have something to contribute. I think, both from a legal background, but also from just a different perspective, and so, 1990, I decided to seek election. And when the filing period opened, I was down there first morning, first hour, filed for election and the justice who I was going to challenge; thought I was going to challenge, resigned before I got out of the secretary of state’s office. 15\nJH: Oh wow.\nAP: Which created a vacancy. Vacancies are filled by appointment. The governor immediately appointed someone to fill the vacancy and the election for that seat no longer existed. And I, in seeking election, it wasn’t about the individual justice who I was going to challenge; it wasn’t about their opinions or their philosophy or their anything else; it was simply—it seemed to me to be a fair question given that the justice was going to reach mandatory retirement within something less than six months of re-election and it was a fair question, at least I thought, to have the people of Minnesota decide who they would want to serve the term.\nMe, a known quantity, a known person, or some unknown, ultimately some unknown person. The election was taken off the ballot and, you know, it wasn’t clear to me why, you know. Being a person of color, one of the things that comes to mind is, Is it because I’m a person of color? Is it politics? Is it—I don’t know—let that go; continued working at the attorney general’s office and decided to try again in 1992.\nThis time, the justice I sought to challenge, was going to reach mandatory retirement within about eighteen months of the full six-year term and I thought again it was fair question to have the people of Minnesota decide who the justice should be who serves in that seat. Before I could get to the—before the filings opened, we had this provision in our constitution which provides for the retirement of the judges and there is a statute which provided, also provides to carry out that constitutional provision, which provided that the governor could extend\n01:05:00 the term of a justice who hadn’t reached full retirement at the time they were up for re-\nelection and with mandatory retirement approaching. And so Justice Yetka [Lawrence R. Yetka (October 1, 1924–November 12, 2017)] who was the justice who I was going to challenge, sought a term extension; the governor granted it and I was, to say the least, more than a little frustrated.\nAnd so, long story short, I commenced a lawsuit against the governor and the secretary of state, a lawsuit that had its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court and a number of people told me I was crazy, that you’re wrong on the law; you’re wrong on the politics and you’re never, you know, when you lose this lawsuit, you’re never, ever going to have the opportunity to serve.\nI felt strongly about one, that the, as applied, the term extension violated the constitution. I wasn’t much concerned about the politics because I’d been—sort of along the way I’d figured out you have to do what you think is right, not what is expedient, and turns out I was right on the law; we were right on the law. And I was given the opportunity, along with anybody else who wanted to file for election for the seat. I filed; Justice Yetka did not and two other people did and almost immediately, not almost immediately, immediately, my opponents started down the road of, He's just a football player. And initially, implicit, but unstated, he’s just a dumb football player. Also initially, but not necessarily subsequently, but initially, he’s just a dumb, black football player. I mean, that was the tenor of what was being said. He’s not qualified. 16\nI spent the next three months, three and a half months, whatever it is, campaigning around the state to talk about why I wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. What I could bring what I had to offer about my experience and my background and my qualifications. And at every turn, I got the accusatory question, What are your qualifications? And nobody else was being asked that. And so that was difficult. That said, it was also satisfying to be able to talk to people about who I am and what I thought I had to offer and in the end, the people of this state gave\n01:10:00 me the opportunity to serve. They elected me. I am humbled, honored. I have a hard time\narticulating how meaningful it is to me that they saw through the effort to stereotype me; that they saw in me somebody who hopefully, had something to contribute and they gave me the opportunity to do it.\nJH: Was—so, you know, you mentioned that, in terms of the campaign, questions about qualification, but implicit questions about—\nAP: Race.\nJH: what it means to be an athlete—race. Was diversity, and the fact that, if elected, you’d be the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice: Was that a part of that conversation explicitly or was that not really a part of that discussion?\nAP: That wasn’t a part of the discussion.\nJH: So you’re elected.\nAP: And I show up the first day.\nJH: What’s the first day like?\nAP: Well, I had a month before, I’d been given briefs for the—\nJH: Get to work.\nAP: Yes, for the argument calendar in January of ’93, and initially I had been assigned a case that was being heard that first day.\nJH: Okay.\nAP: Mind you, I had—I didn’t know how the system worked, right?\nJH: Right. The norms, the processes—\nAP: The norms, the processes, any of it. And so I’m fast tracking, trying to figure all this out and it turns out the case that they gave me, I had a conflict. Phew! So they switched cases and gave me one for the second day. I was getting my baptism by fire. I, you know, read the briefs, prepared—didn’t know what—and for my case the second day, as you know, we do a 17\nreport to the court, I’d never done a report to the court because I hadn’t been on the court. But I had to sort of figure that out but I had no sort of context for doing that. And the—I was sworn in before the first argument the first day and we were having a public ceremony after it.\nJH: That very first day.\nAP: That very first day, public swearing in.\nJH: There were some distractions beyond the work of the court.\nAP: One or two. And sat through the one argument because I was recused on the other but sat through my first case conference and learned what a report was like. Do the public swearing in ceremony; celebrate with family, and at the end of the day, get that report written.\nJH: And that report on your mind kind of throughout the day a little bit?\nAP: Oh, absolutely.\nJH: Yeah, I got to get that report; I’ve got some work to do.\nAP: I’ve got some work to do. At least now I know what it is. And the second day I had\n01:15:00 my—we had the two cases I sat through, gave my report and that’s the way it begins. We\ndon’t do that anymore. At least when I left the court, new justices had some time to learn the system.\nJH: So was that a, I mean, do you think back on the first—beyond the first day or two, the first week; the first month, as I said, because it was trial by fire a little bit right away that it was an easy transition? I mean, hard by the way, but a quick one or—?\nAP: Invigorating, and a very quick transition. You know, as with anything new, particularly in the world of work, you don’t know the rules and the norms until you violate them and so you’re trying to figure it all out and, you know, you have your missteps along the way but you figure it out and, as with many things, the question isn’t whether you made the mistake, but what did you learn from it. In this particular instance, I had to be a quick learner and I was.\nJH: Absolutely.\nAP: And then, you know, you get that first case behind you, the argument and the report, and then you’ve got to write—\nJH: You’ve got some more work to do. It’s not over.\nAP: And having never written an opinion before, you have to learn how to do that.\nJH: Which is a whole other beast in and of itself. 18\nAP: Absolutely, but I had a good law clerk, Ian Nemiroff, who helped me a lot. He helped me a lot. And as over the years, I had a bunch of great clerks who made me look good time and time again.\nJH: I wanted to ask about clerks, not in a selfish way, but it’s definitely a part of your work on the court, daily work on the court. What did you look for in a clerk?\nAP: I looked for people who were curious; people who had something in their background that was out of the norm. Justice Gardebring [Sandra Gardebring Ogren (June 14, 1947–July 20, 2010)] used to refer to what she called Standard Issue Law Students, SILS (laughter). I didn’t want Standard Issue Law clerks. I wanted people who—obviously you want somebody that can write; you want somebody that’s going to work hard. But you want somebody who’s going to have good judgment and a sense of curiosity to sort of look under the rocks that need to be looked under and not under the ones that don’t and who can figure that out pretty quickly. And who are willing to or who were willing to tell me when I was wrong. I didn’t need a law clerk or law clerks who would tell me what I want to hear. I don’t like surprises and so, when I’m working with a clerk, I want the clerk to make sure there are no surprises.\nJH: Right.\nAP: And I was pretty lucky along the way—a bunch of great writers, yourself included; hard workers; curiosity—you fit the bill nicely.\nJH: Well, it’s—I always talk about, too. It’s one of those incredible experiences where you get out of law school and then the work, in many ways, it feels like some of the most\n01:20:00 important work that you’ll do as an attorney, working on the court so pretty incredible\nexperience.\nSo talk about—I recall in the year in your office—\nAP: I should also note, I wanted diversity in my clerks. I wanted women; I wanted clerks who were people of color; I wanted diversity in their, you know, where they came from; what their experiences were—because all of that makes; all of that enriches the process and makes what I do as a judge better having different views, different ways of looking at things and I mean, I think that’s vital.\nJH: Your approach to tackling an opinion. I remember you taking, I think, a lot of joy in peeling apart the layers, finding the resolution, and obviously, as you’ve said many times before, none of the cases that come before the Minnesota Supreme Court are simple. They’re there because they’re complex. Talk about that a little bit.\nAP: They’re there because they’re complex; they’re there because they’re important to the people involved in them, no matter who they are, whether it’s a—the fifth petition for review from a post-conviction inmate, or, you know, some large corporation, it’s important to the people that we serve. It’s important to the people of the state that we do it well and that we do 19\nit as right as we can. And I—opinion writing is—on any given day I will tell you it’s more art than science or that it’s more science than art.\nJH: Right.\nAP: It’s really a combination of both and for me, it was very important to work with the word so that what the opinion said was clear, easily understood, easily read and helpful. And to do that for me, it was about making sure that there were no unintended words, much less unintended ideas but no unintended words that—every word was thought about; that every word was where it was in the sentence because that’s the best use of the word in communicating the idea that you’re trying to communicate. That every sentence in the paragraph was where it was because that was the best way to communicate what you were trying to communicate in the paragraph. That every paragraph in the opinion was where it was because that’s where it was most helpful.\n01:25:00 I suspect that you clerks probably thought I was a little obsessive and maybe even a little\ncompulsive but certainly obsessive about words, how we used the language, but that was important to me; that was very important to me.\nJH: I remember you talked right away about the purpose of every word. If it doesn’t have a role; if it’s not there for a reason,\nAP: Gone.\nJH: Get it out.\nAP: If it doesn’t have a reason, it’s not helping anybody. All it does is add length and the potential for confusion.\nJH: And the potential for interpretation differently than the intent was.\nAP: Different than what you intended.\nJH: Right, I remember that lesson. It sticks with me for sure. I was always struck with the collegiality and rapport on the court. You know, it was a serious place; a lot of important work, but I also remember, at least feeling like, the justices had a lot of respect for one another and were good friends as well. Can you speak to that a little bit?\nAP: Well, you know, it’s interesting. You have seven people, and changing all the time, who have big brains; who would like to think they’re the smartest one in the room; who have views that conflict and who feel strongly about their opinions. But we’ve been lucky here in Minnesota to have people understand that the institution is more important than any one of us and institutionally, it is important to maintain that collegiality, even when your colleagues, in your view, are so far wrong that you can’t understand how they could possibly be there. And sometimes the tension is pretty high but in the end you have to understand that a.) it’s about the institution and the work; it’s not about me. And also, you have to understand that, you 20\nknow, some day you may need that colleague to get where you want to go in a particular case or where you think a case should go.\nWhen I first got on the court I would hear these stories about what was going on in other states with their Supreme Courts. Justices inviting one another out into the corridor to have a fight; justices showing up at conference and placing a handgun on the conference table. How does that work? How can you have a justice system that—or that the members of which of\n01:30:00 their courts are so antagonistic with one another that they can’t be civil even, you know, under\npressure? How do you reach good decisions doing that? I don’t think you can. One of the things that was also, I think, important for our court during my time there, to ensure the understanding that collegiality was important and that it’s the institution, it’s not us, was that we, in our conference, you know, there are seven of us. We know each other by first name. We refer to each other as Justice So and So, just to make it clear in our own minds and everybody else in the room, that this is an institutional decision we’re making. This is the institution that is acting; it’s not me, Alan Page, making a decision. I’m making it on behalf of this institution. And it’s a way to sort of force you to treat people with respect and I think it served us well.\nJH: Those small things are not small things.\nAP: Not small at all.\nJH: Right.\nAP: Not small at all.\nJH: Right. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the first—the critical first of being the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice? Sort of looking back and thinking about the role of that first in your work on the court?\nAP: I have a hard time doing that because that wasn’t what it was about. Institutionally, I think it’s important that there had to be a first. Institutionally, it would have been better had it been somebody long before me. The fact that it finally happened—that we finally opened the door if you will for people of color, I think it was very significant. I think equally significant was the fact that when I joined the court, the court was a majority of women.\nJH: That’s right.\nAP: People would ask me, What’s it like serving on the court with a majority of women, right? And, of course, having not served on a court that wasn’t a majority of women, I thought, Well, that’s the natural order of things. But those things are important—that our judicial—that people who serve in our judicial system reflect the people of this state. I’ve said many times that the only power that courts have is founded in the trust and confidence of the people we serve and the less the members of the judiciary look like the people they serve, the less trust and confidence our judiciary will have. And so I think finally breaking that barrier was critically important. 21\n01:35:00 JH: Right. On that note, I mean, early on in your tenure as a justice—and I want to get this\nright—your service on the Minnesota Supreme Court Task Force on Racial Bias in the Judicial System. Report’s issued in 1993.\nAP: Six months after I joined the court.\nJH: Right. And you were involved.\nAP: Well, I—\nJH: Can you just describe that a little bit or what was your participation; what was your experience?\nAP: I became the chair of the committee that was going to implement the task force report. That was challenging for me. Remember my interest in the law was the law and not in being an administrator? And so from that standpoint, a lot of the things that, not only that committee, but we all—we had various committee assignments. I have to say those committee assignments were not my favorite part of being on the court.\nBut this was an important one and, you know, we ended up working through the—depending on how you count them—the one hundred plus recommendations, pretty much most of them being implemented. But—and the implementation made things better but it didn’t solve the problem. It was a little—I think we made very incremental progress. But the disparities that came out of the report, particularly in the criminal justice area, where African-Americans, people of color are arrested more often; stopped more often; charged more often; given higher bail; less fair trials; higher conviction rates; longer sentences; all things being equal, that hasn’t ended and that’s just on the criminal justice side. There’s the juvenile justice and all the other aspects of the report.\nI’ve more or less come to the conclusion that before real change is going to happen, we have to take a more fundamental look at what our law is grounded in, which is to say, it’s grounded in a constitution that counted those imported as slaves as three-fifths of a person. And while we’ve had the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments ending slavery, ensuring due process and guaranteeing the right to vote, the law itself, the foundation, is still on cases that arose out of slavery and we’ve got to figure out how to tease that out of it before we have fundamental change.\nJH: Structural fundamental change, right?\n01:40:00 AP: It’s a structural, systemic problem.\nJH: What about, Justice Page, any notable opinions; dissents; anything come to mind? You wrote a lot so it’s a big body of work but—?\n22\nAP: I have never, in my own head, quantified or qualified whether it was a dissent or an opinion in terms of its importance. It seems to me that once you do that; once you decide that this one is more important than that one, you start doing both of them a disservice. And so I just took each one as they came and tried to put the same energy and effort into trying to get it right. And again, as I say, whether it was that fifth post-conviction petition, or, you know, some mega million dollar corporate issue, the people who come before us deserve to have our fullest attention and so I just don’t qualify them, quantify them in that way.\nJH: Don’t think of it as that, right? So, during your tenure on the court, one thing I wanted to ask you about, too, is just sort of the interplay, if you think of there being one at all, between your continued community engagement and still working on the court. You know, we would—I think back a lot on going and reading with you and other staff in the court, reading to elementary school kids on Wednesdays or whatever day it was. That community engagement and, you know, did that play a role in your work in your works as a justice? Did you see it sort of separately or was it related and did it inform your work?\nAP: Oh, I think everything we do -- our lives inform our work. I don’t know that I, you know, my reading with kids or my involvement to the extent that I had it, which was quite limited at the Page Education Foundation, influenced my work directly but it’s a part of who I am and being engaged in the community around us at some level helps us understand those people we are a part of but also who we represent. And I think it would be a mistake to be isolated and not a part of the world around us to the extent, obviously, to the extent possible, to the extent that it doesn’t create conflicts.\nJH: You’ve had some time now after retiring, I suppose to think back. Any, I guess maybe the question is, in thinking about it and this kind of gets to some final reflections about your time on the court, it’s a big question, but what is it—personally and professionally—can you put into words what the service meant to you?\nAP: Well, for me, it was the most, in terms of my professional life, the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. The challenges of working with seven other people. I mean, I looked forward to every day when I was on the court, particularly to those days where we would hear argument and have conferences because every conference you got stretched in ways that you would never get stretched and I loved that. Trying to understand what your colleagues are saying and thinking; trying to understand what you were thinking in the context of what they are saying and thinking and trying to understand what you were thinking.\nJH: Work through thought processes, right.\nAP: And working through all that doesn’t get any better.\nJH: Sometimes arriving at unexpected places, too?\nAP: Oh, all the time, all the time. Arriving at unexpected places; arriving at places that, on a personal level, you wouldn’t want to arrive at. You—if I could decide this on my own, this is not what I would do, but not my choice, you know. One of the—a little bit disconcerting 23\nthings about our society—is I don’t think people understand how important it is for judges to be impartial and to exercise their judgment and not impose their will. And just the challenge of doing that all the time and trying to get that right, it’s all very much fun; very invigorating; very satisfying. And, hopefully, in the end, I did it as well as I could do it. I leave that up to others to decide but that was certainly my goal and I enjoyed every minute of it along the way.\nJH: What about the future of the court? You’re not on it, obviously, anymore, but thinking about challenges, hopes; any thoughts come to mind about the future?\nAP: My hope would be that they continue to be independent; that they continue to act impartially and understand that it is about the exercise of judgment and if the court’s members can do that it’ll have a bright future. And there’s something about, at least from my experience on the court looking back and looking forward, I think there’s a pretty good chance that things will continue in that regard as they have.\nThe court’s leadership understands. I had the good fortune to serve with, let me think—I knew the number exactly at one time. Let’s see—one, two three—I can’t remember the exact number—six or seven or eight—\n01:50:00 JH: Chief justices?\nAP: chief justices and each one of them got it. They were all different but each one of them understood how important it is for our court to maintain its independence and its impartiality and to make decisions based on the law and the facts and their best judgment and not on the way the wind is blowing today. We’ve been lucky to have really good people, both at the chief justice, as chief justices, and as associate justices and I, to be included in that group is pretty special.\nJH: You know, I want to definitely, before we close out, give you an opportunity to speak to your late wife Diane’s [Diane Sims Page (1944-September 30, 2018)], role in your career.\nAP: Well, I mentioned earlier about that forty thousand dollars I lost on the vending machines?\nJH: Yeah, that’s right.\nAP: The company that owned the vending machines was a subsidiary of General Mills.\nJH: I know where this is going now.\nAP: And, long story short, I was in the lobby at General Mills one day, having left the meeting and left my car keys and everything else in the meeting and I’m sitting, waiting for somebody to bring them back to me and Diane walks into a meeting that she was going to there. I got introduced to her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Absolutely the best thing that ever happened to me. She is the love of my life; she kept me grounded at the same time lifting me up. She had this magic ability to lift people up, no matter who they 24\nwere; no matter what the circumstances were. She had incredible insight into people and she is in large measure the key to much of the success that I’ve had. She was there every step of the way, allowing me, encouraging me, supporting me. And, as I say, I couldn’t have been luckier to have met her, fallen in love with her and spent the years that we had together. And she was one of those people who—I have ideas. She was a doer.\nJH: Executor.\nAP: Absolutely, and it wasn’t, you know, When are you going to get this done? It’s, Why wasn’t this done yesterday? Well, because we just found out that we had to do it today. She was in a sense, driven and driven to do good; driven to make this world a better place, that’s for sure. And I got lucky.\n01:55:00 JH: Well, you have retired from the court but you’re busy.\nAP: I am busy.\nJH: And so I’ve got to ask, what’s next? What’s next for Justice Page?\nAP: Well, there’s still plenty of work to do with the Page Education Foundation and beyond that, I’m trying to figure out what I’m going to do when I grow up. I haven’t sorted that out yet but I spend a lot of time in schools and classrooms still, talking to young children. As you know, I’ve had the good fortune to be able to write three children’s books with my youngest daughter and we’ve got to get on to book four.\nJH: I was going to ask; that was my next question.\nAP: We’ve got to get on to book four.\nJH: More work to be done.\nAP: More work to be done.\nJH: And Justice Page Middle School? I mean, it seems you spend time—I see pictures and things and you’re really engaged with the school.\nAP: I am engaged with the school. The school is magic. You know, sixth, seventh, eighth graders—they energize me still. They keep me going. And I also have four grandchildren that do the same thing.\nJH: Being a grandfather, a job in and of itself.\nAP: Yes.\nJH: Well, I think that’s a good place to close. Unless you have any other thoughts. We’ve had a good conversation so thanks for sharing your insights today. And thank you, I think in 25\nthinking about this conversation through the arc from beginning to end and the focus on the Minnesota Supreme Court, I want to and then I thank and we all want to thank you for your service on the Supreme Court, too.\nAP: Well, thank you for that, but I can’t articulate how much I loved serving on the court and being able to serve the people of this state. I can’t articulate how honored I am that the people of this state gave me the opportunity to do it and I don’t know—well, let me just back up. You know, one of the humbling things about serving is you’re there; you’re working on cases and you’re looking at cases from 1860, trying to figure out what the law is today because it’s grounded in something that took place back then. The idea that cases that I worked on when I was on the court will be used one hundred fifty, two hundred years from now, that the law will be grounded in something that I was a part of during my tenure, it’s almost overwhelming.\nJH: It’s an awesome thought.\nAP: I just hope that I didn’t goof it up so that hopefully what I did; what we did when I was on the court will make their jobs easier.\nJH: Sure. A good note to end on.\nAP: Thank you.\nJH: Thank you, appreciate it. It was good to talk to you Justice Page.\nAP: Good to see you, Jeff.\nEnd of Recording\n02:00:18"

It’s February 19, 2019, and I’m at the Continuing Legal Education Center [Minnesota CLE Conference Center, 600 Nicollet Mall #370, Minneapolis, MN] in\\nMinneapolis [Minneapolis, MN] to interview retired Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page [Alan Cedric Page (August 7, 1945-)] for the Minnesota Supreme Court Oral History Project. The project is sponsored by the Minnesota Supreme Court Historical Society and its Preservation Committee in cooperation with the Minnesota State Law Library [Minnesota State Law Library, 25 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, St Paul, MN]. My name is Jeff Holth. I’m a practicing attorney here in Minnesota and I clerked for Justice Page from 2012 to 2013 and I’ll be conducting the interview today.\\nThank you for coming today, Justice Page, and for agreeing to share your experiences and insights on your years on the court.\\nAP: Well, thank you for inviting me and hopefully we can have a fun conversation.\\nJH: Agreed. So let’s jump right in. I know you graduated from law school in around 1978 and served on the Supreme Court from ’93 [1993] to 2015, but I want to start by asking you about your earlier life before we talk about your years on the court.\\nAP: Sure.\\nJH: So I wonder if you could just start us off by talking a little bit about your family and where you grew up.\\nAP: I was born in Canton, Ohio. I was the fourth of four children. My mother was a—worked as an attendant in a country club and my father, various jobs from operating juke boxes to running a bar—that sort of thing. As I say, I was the fourth of four children, two sisters and a brother. My childhood was a pretty happy one, pretty uneventful, not much exciting to talk about. We weren’t the wealthiest of families, but we weren’t the poorest either.\\n3\\nMy parents, neither one had the opportunity to go to school beyond high school and they emphasized for me and my brother and my sisters, the importance of education and the importance of being good citizens. And in their own way, something that, I think, stuck with me, they talked about and emphasized the importance of seeking excellence. Now they didn’t say it that way, but I think that’s the bottom line of what they were talking about. They would always—and I can hear them now telling me, Whatever you do in life, do it as well as you can. You’re going to be a garbage collector, be the best garbage collector you can be. If you’re going to be a doctor, be the best doctor you can be. Not as good as the next doctor or garbage collector, but the best one you can be. And that’s something that they preached and, I think, has served me well over time.\\nJH: I think I recall you talking about, you know, at a pretty young age, having some experiences or influences that sort of made you think you might want to be a lawyer someday. Can you talk about that a little bit?\\nAP: I very early on, you know, when I was eight, nine, ten years old, people would ask me what I wanted to do when I grew up and I would say I wanted to be a lawyer. And, you know, what eight-year-old knows really what they want to do when they grow up? But, as I noted, I grew up in Canton, Ohio. It was a town built on heavy industry, primarily steel, and I had an uncle who spent forty years working in the steel mill. And I knew intuitively that that’s not something that I wanted to do. Nothing wrong with working in steel mills, but from my eight-\\n00:05:00 year-old eyes, the work was dirty; it was hard; it was dangerous and repetitious. And\\nsomehow I knew that that didn’t fit me.\\nI’d heard stories about lawyers, that, you know, from—not that I knew any lawyers, or had any lawyers in my family or my family really knew any lawyers, but the impression in the community I grew up was that lawyers didn’t work too hard; made lots of money; drove big, fancy cars; lived in big houses and went out and played golf every Wednesday afternoon. But for the eight-year-old mind balancing fancy cars and dangerous and dirty work—\\nJH: Which do I choose?\\nAP: Which do I choose? It becomes real simple. I also grew up watching Perry Mason [Perry Mason, CBS television from September 21, 1957, to May 22, 1966], and so I had a very rudimentary sense of what the law was about from that television show and finally, and something that influenced me greatly. You have to remember that I grew up—I was eight years old in 1954. At the time our country was grounded in state sponsored segregation and in 1954, the Supreme Court decided Brown versus the Board of Education[of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483] and I can remember reading newspaper stories about it; hearing people talk about it; and again, not that I understood it fully, but it gave me a sense of the power that the law has. That if the courts, through the law, could essentially sound the death knell for state sponsored segregation, it had the power to change how people treat one another. And that’s something that I grew up [with] and had an interest in.\\nAs I got older, I was disabused of the idea that lawyers didn’t work hard (laughter) or that they necessarily made lots and lots of money, but I also developed the sense that the law was 4\\nabout solving problems and helping people and that’s also something that resonated with me. And so that was sort of my dream for the future. And never lost it, never lost it. And, again, you know, 1954 there was Brown. Along the way there were—there was Little Rock [Little Rock, AR]; there was Birmingham [Birmingham, AL]; there were full blown civil rights movements, an effort to change or address issues of race in ways that hadn’t been successful in the past. And, I’m sure that all had some bearing on my sense of what the law was about and what could be done with the law.\\nJH: You know, thinking about Brown v. Board, specifically, do you, I mean, what was Canton like growing up sort of in terms of a racial makeup? Was it a pretty segregated, in fact, city?\\nAP: Absolutely. Absolutely. You knew where you belonged and didn’t belong and it’s interesting. I didn’t grow up in an area where the segregation was state sponsored, but in practical effect, it might as well have been.\\n00:10:00 JH: So let’s talk briefly about Central Catholic High School, your high school experience\\nin Canton. Was it the plan for you to attend Central Catholic because your family did or was it football related, or what was the trajectory there?\\nAP: Well, our family moved from Canton out into the countryside with an East Canton, Ohio, address because my parents felt that the education available in the Canton city schools wasn’t what they wanted for us. And my two older sisters, interestingly, didn’t decide to go to school in East Canton. They, and along with my parents, concluded that Canton Central Catholic had the best possible education for our circumstances. And so they ended up going to Central Catholic. And then, my brother, who was ahead of me, he went and so, I was destined to follow.\\nAnd I—before I got to high school, I hadn’t really—I wasn’t much of an athlete as a kid; I wasn’t one of those kids that everybody sort of sought after to come and be on their team, but my brother went out for football and so when I got there, I went out and it, as it turns out, I evidently had some aptitude for it.\\nJH: I’ve heard you use that phrase, “Have some aptitude for it,” before, yeah. So what do you, in terms of high school, do you remember having an early interest in sort of the law and politics and those sort of things or were you still sort of navigating and not quite sure—?\\nAP: I think I was always interested in politics from very early on. But only in the sense of trying to figure out how it works to help people. I never had much interest in politics for politics’ sake. And so when I got to high school, I mean, I—the courses I loved were, you know, back then it was civics and government—those kind of classes.\\nJH: So was there a point—so you played football at Central Catholic and is there a point, even in high school, where you think that football could be used as a way to pursue an education or does that realization not happen until a little bit later or—?\\n5\\nAP: You know, growing up in Canton, there was this conflict between athletics and academics. There was a very strong emphasis on athletics, particularly in the African-American community and so I’m growing up not much interested in football and seeing an inordinate number of young men who had—I guess what you would call stellar high school football careers—go off to college for two, three, four years, come back to Canton, ended up hanging out on the street corner, unemployed and unemployable. And, you know, that didn’t make sense to me. I couldn’t figure out—this was before I started playing football. Then I started playing, as I said, more by accident than by design and I loved playing but I was just playing football because I loved it and not for any other purpose.\\n00:15:00 By the time I was a, you know, sophomore/junior, there was talk that I might be able to obtain\\nan athletic scholarship and so I suppose around that time I started thinking about [how] it could be used. One of the, in hindsight, one of the disappointments when I look back is that while I did okay as a student in high school; did okay as a student in elementary and junior high school; I did it the easy way. I didn’t, essentially I wasn’t there to learn how to learn. I was there to do the work and I could do the work without learning how to learn. I could, you know, answer the questions and work through the math problems and all of that but simply because you can do the work, doesn’t mean that you’re really learning a whole lot because, I think, the important part of what goes on in schools in the education process is learning how to learn and so I sort of missed that.\\nAnd so as, in high school, the work got more difficult, I still, you know, thrived to some degree, but had I learned how to learn early on, I think, I mean, I was focused on going to school beyond high school because that was the emphasis my parents placed, but if I had sort of made that connection to learning how to learn early on, I might have had a little more success academically and not, I don’t focus on that so much because, you know, I could have been—done better in school—but I would have been better prepared for the future.\\nAs it turned out, I did okay, and ended up receiving a number of scholarship offers, athletic scholarship offers. I think had I had that—had I learned how to learn—there might have been some academic scholarships in that queue also, which gives you choices, right?\\nJH: Sure.\\nAP: But I had the opportunity to choose among some pretty good schools and ultimately selected the University of Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN].\\nJH: That’s a good transition to Notre Dame and talk a little bit about your time in college. Why Notre Dame?\\nAP: Primarily because of its academic reputation and because of its reputation in terms of how it interacted with its alumni. They have an incredible, had then, and continue to have, an incredible alumni association which provides any number of benefits to people who graduate\\n00:20:00 from there in terms of employment opportunities and other kinds of support. And, you know,\\nas I say, the schools that I was choosing from, they were all good schools. I mean, it was Purdue [Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN]; it was Michigan State 6\\n[Michigan State University, 220 Trowbridge Road, East Lansing, MI]; it was Michigan [University of Michigan, 500 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI]; Minnesota [University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN]; Ohio State [Ohio State University, Columbus, OH]. So it wasn’t like they didn’t have some of the things that Notre Dame had to offer. But it was sort of looking beyond the college years that was, I think, ultimately the deciding factor.\\nThat, coupled with, I had no interest in going to Ohio State, who knows why? And Notre Dame also had this reputation, football wise, that, at least at the time, was about as good as it got, you know, to a black kid from Canton, Ohio, going to play in the house that Knute Rockne [Knute Kenneth Rockne (March 4, 1888–March 31, 1931)] built, that sort of put stars in your eyes for sure.\\nJH: So was that an exciting time I would suspect in a lot of ways? Was it a nerve wracking time transitioning from Canton and leaving home, or—?\\nAP: It was an exciting time; a very difficult time. I, you know, just going back to Central Catholic, I was one of two, I think, maybe three; maybe four; African-American kids in my graduating class. Going off to Notre Dame it was going to be, you know, there were a few more, but not many more so—and it was at a time that sort of our national economy was sort of in a downward spiral and Notre Dame is in South Bend, Indiana, and they were also a heavy industry town and one of the main employers there was Studebaker, the auto manufacturer, and they went out of business just about the time I got there. It was my first time away from home really. I’d not been a kid who’d gone off to camp and spent any time away from home so it was all new to me. And it was also, you know, the first time that I’d really been put in a position where I was responsible for myself as every kid who goes off to school is.\\nJH: Sure, that’s a big change.\\nAP: A huge change. And so it was difficult. And one of the things I didn’t realize was Notre Dame was not the most progressive place to go to school and so that was something that was a little different for me and having to adjust to that. There were some difficult transitions.\\nJH: Speaking to kind of the economy, in a downturn, thinking about that time, too, and in a lot of ways the civil rights movement is sort of at its apex and the Voting Rights Act and so was that a part of the campus conversation or do you recall anything about that?\\n00:25:00 AP: Not much, a little bit, but not much. You know, and being on the football team there,\\nyou really weren’t necessarily that much a part of the campus conversation, even though we were—we lived in the dorms with everybody else and went to meals with everybody else and went to classes with everybody else, your focal point was football and so you weren’t really much connected.\\nAnd it was really kind of an interesting time in that respect because, I mean, the civil rights movement was going through some challenging times. About the same time, the Vietnam War protests started and so it’s sort of like you’re in this bubble looking out on all of this and not 7\\nhaving a direct connection to it but having the opportunity to at least see it and think about it but not engage.\\nJH: Well, it’s interesting you mention that because yeah, in thinking about it, the focus on football and you’re a young kid still and transitioning so maybe not a lot of capacity for a lot of other stuff when that’s the focus in a lot of ways.\\nAP: Even if you had the instinct, they took up your time and your energy, both physical and emotional. And so it was, in that respect, I missed out on a lot but, you know, I can’t remember the precise timing, but my freshman year, the start of my freshman year, went to football training camp a couple of weeks before school started and I think we got there either just before or just after the March on Washington [The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 1963]. I think school had started by the time the bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church [The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. September 15, 1963), Birmingham, AL] had occurred in Birmingham. And so you had all of these things going on. As I noted, you’re sort of watching from afar. And understanding that they affect you, but sort of not directly.\\nJH: Removed a little bit or, yeah. Well, the focus on football bore some fruit. National championship—was it your senior year?\\nAP: Yes. I should note, I think it was in the—I think it was still while I was there or he was planning to come, one of our speakers, one of the people who was coming to campus to speak was George Wallace [George Corley Wallace Jr. (August 25, 1919–September 13, 1998)]. That got people engaged.\\nJH: That got some attention?\\nAP: That got some attention.\\nJH: Did he come? Do you remember?\\nAP: I’m pretty sure it was while I was still there. Needless to say, I didn’t attend.\\nJH: Yeah, probably not a regret.\\nAP: No.\\nJH: So, you’re drafted by the Vikings kind of at the close of your career at Notre Dame and kind of moving ahead a little bit, there’s obviously lots to talk about that we could talk\\n00:30:00 about with respect to your professional career in the NFL and—\\nAP: It happened.\\nJH: It happened. It happened. You’ve talked about it a little bit, right? But I want to focus on just kind of one unique aspect that I was interested about was your participation in the NFL 8\\nPlayers Association. It’s something that I, you know, I’ve—I know you’ve talked about it before but we don’t hear that quite as often so I was just curious. You’re playing with the Vikings. How do you get involved in the Players Association and what’s sort of your role?\\nAP: Well, there had been—this is a long, complicated story, too long and too complicated for here.\\nJH: It’s a big question.\\nAP: There had been various efforts on the part of players to organize before 1968. Nineteen sixty the league is confronted with another football league, the American Football League. In 1966, those two leagues merge with the merger taking place in ’68 and in 1968, the players from both leagues come together and form the National Football League Players Association. That was my second year in the league and somehow I either volunteered or agreed to serve as player representative. So that’s how I got involved.\\nAnd, growing up in Canton, I was used to organized labor and had sort of a sense of what it was about and the other piece of it was that the reason players wanted to come together to form a union was because—well, there are a whole host of them, not the least of which is players essentially had no rights in terms of where they could play; very little ability to impact how much they were paid and then there were all these what I will call silly little rules that were imposed, I suppose, as a matter of control. That’s all I can think of. Things like you can’t have a beard or a mustache. I guess you could have a mustache but you couldn’t have a beard. Things like, you know, you have to be at every meal whether you want to eat or not. You have to—you can’t have a telephone in your room and this was before, you know, mobile phones, but you couldn’t have the telephone company put a phone in your room during training camp. I mean, those are just a couple that come to mind.\\nAnd so there were really lots of limitations on a player’s ability to be themselves and players wanted to change that and obviously, the ability to choose where you worked would have an\\n00:35:00 impact on how much you were paid. And so, I think for me, at least in the beginning, it was\\nsort of all those little controls that just drove me crazy, that got me involved. And, you know, once you—you can’t get just a little bit wet once you’re into the pool you get all wet.\\nJH: Did you enjoy it?\\nAP: I loved it. It was frustrating at times but I think we laid the groundwork for the freedom that players have today. We laid the groundwork for players getting a fair share of the revenue. We laid the groundwork that allowed players to be treated like human beings as opposed to, in some sense, property. And along the way, I got to meet, know and work with a bunch of great lawyers. Leonard Lindquist [Leonard Lindquist (September 5, 1912-September 10, 2004)]; Gene Keating [Eugene Henry Keating (January 2, 1932-April 6, 2005)]; Ed Glennon [Edward M. Glennon (1924-April 24, 2009)]; Ed Garvey [Edward R. Garvey (April 18, 1940–February 22, 2017)]. I got to see from the inside what the law was all about and what good lawyering looks like.\\n9\\nJH: So is it fair to say that that was an influence on the decision to pursue a career?\\nAP: That just confirmed—\\nJH: That it was something you wanted to do.\\nAP: That it was something I wanted to do. I enrolled at William Mitchell [now Mitchell Hamline School of Law, 875 Summit Avenue, St. Paul, MN] in the fall of 1968. I started my second year the league and it was not pretty.\\nJH: Why not?\\nAP: Well, you know, you get that assignment over the summer and there are like five hundred pages to read and you try to read it and none of it makes sense and you show up the first day and I don’t remember what the class was, but the professor could just as well be talking Greek as English. And, you think, I don’t understand what’s happening here because it’s a different process; at least it was a different process from what my undergraduate degree was like. And I was not ready for it.\\nJH: Was it—well, you said you were second year in the league, playing and so was it—I mean, I’d suspect that obviously that has—playing is a lot of—the time commitment in and of itself so was it that you weren’t quite ready? Not enough time? Or did it—?\\nAP: It wasn’t that. It was being confronted with being in this class and listening to these lectures that had no context.\\nJH: Right.\\nAP: And therefore made no sense. And, you know, it’s early on in the process so you don’t know how it all fits together.\\nJH: New language.\\nAP: New language, all of it. And I just—it was not pretty. (laughter)\\nJH: Well, but it must not have—but it didn’t dissuade you, obviously, completely.\\nAP: I say only half in jest, I knew after three days that I wasn’t going to survive, but I was in so far over my head that it took me another three and a half, three weeks to figure out how to drop out, to get out. And I—what I came to understand was, first of all, that I wasn’t alone.\\n00:40:00 I mean, I’m sitting there thinking, I’m the only one that doesn’t get this. I’m the only one that\\ndoesn’t understand this. But, you know, everybody in the room was in the same boat that I was. Had I—maybe had I not been playing football at the time, I’d have sort of stuck it out, but I mean, I was so far in over my head, I mean, I just couldn’t see—\\n10\\nJH: The path.\\nAP: The path.\\nJH: Yep, overwhelming.\\nAP: And so, I bailed. But didn’t necessarily give up the hope or the idea. Over the years I tried one or two other career options. I was a used car salesman or actually a new/used car salesman. I sold one car during my auto sales experience.\\nJH: I did not know that, that you tried that.\\nAP: And the one car I sold to myself. (laughter) So I figured there was no career in that. I had a vending machine company for about a year and half. It took me—I invested about forty thousand dollars into it and it took me about a year and a half to go through that, although that was one of the—actually not one of—the best investment I ever made and we’ll get to that later, but one of the things I was learning was business, being in business, was not something that fit me; not something that interested me; not something that I wanted to put the time and energy and effort into becoming good at, which was a good lesson to learn. And ultimately, after my eighth year with the Vikings, I decided to go back to law school; this time having a better understanding, having been involved in, as a players’ rep, and then ultimately on the executive committee of the Players Association; been involved in a number of lawsuits involving the Players Association and the National Football League.\\nStill, having the opportunity to see even more deeply how lawyers work, the way they thought, developing a sense for that and having the opportunity to talk with them and sort of learn that law school is just like that and that the secret to it is to endure. And at some point it starts to make sense. So after my eighth year I decided to go back. This time enrolled at the University of Minnesota and actually started the summer of 1975 at the University of Texas in Austin [Austin, TX]. I took contracts and procedures, thirteen weeks start to finish.\\nJH: Wow!\\nAP: And survived it.\\nJH: There you go.\\nAP: Not only survived it; loved every minute of it.\\nJH: Confidence booster?\\nAP: Big confidence booster.\\nJH: Absolutely.\\n11\\nAP: Big confidence booster. Learned, you know, a little bit of the process of, remember how I talked about having failed to learn how to learn?\\nJH: Exactly.\\nAP: Took me to law school to get it.\\nJH: Sometimes I wonder if it takes a lot of people up until that point. In some ways, I sort\\n00:45:00 of felt the same way.\\nAP: Well, but once I got it—\\nJH: Yeah.\\nAP: there’s nothing else like it.\\nJH: Right.\\nAP: And so I loved the law school experience. People, you know, are always talking about, Well, you went to law school and played professional football—how hard that must have been. Yeah, things are hard but when you’re having fun, there’s nothing better. I mean, I loved my law school experience at the university.\\nAnd I had another one of those defining moments and I think it was towards the end of my first year. We had a paper to write and I decided I was going to, you know, take the easy road, something you know about, labor, labor law. And actually I think I wrote something on labor relations in the NFL. But I, you know, I spent all this time doing the research and preparing and I just—nothing happened. And I can remember going in to see one of the associate or assistant deans and saying, I don’t know that I can do this. And he said, Well, you can do it. All you have to do is apply yourself. And I think, What have I been doing?\\nJH: Well, that clears it up, right?\\nAP: Right. And he said, No, you apply the seat of your pants to the chair until you get it, until it starts coming and, you know, it’s weird but, you know, I sat down, got my books and my pens and my papers and sat there and eventually started writing and got it done. And that was an important lesson—that sometimes even when you know what you want to do, but it’s not coming together, you have to just keep working at it until it happens.\\nJH: This is jumping ahead a little bit so we’ll have to swing back but that makes me think about the process of sitting down and writing an opinion a little bit, too. Is there a similarity there, too? The process of just needing to sit down and sort of delve in to get it started and once it’s started, flows a little bit?\\nAP: It flows. Absolutely.\\n12\\nJH: Interesting. So law school at U of M. I was going to ask you and I think you really answered it was, you know, by the time you do go to the U of M, you’re still playing; raising a family; not like there aren’t any other things going on. You’re busy but you manage it by—\\nAP: But then it’s just a matter of time management.\\nJH: Sure.\\nAP: And figuring out how to, you know, make it all work, putting all the pieces together. And I mean, I did have some incentive. I mean, by then I was twelve years into my professional career. You don’t play forever and quite frankly, I didn’t want to necessarily play forever. As I’ve said often, by the time I started law school, I’d been playing for—I was into my ninth year and I hadn’t done everything you could do on a football field but I’d done most of them and I noted earlier, repetition wasn’t one of my strong suits. It was time to prepare to do something different so that I could move on. As I’ve often said, you know, the skills of a defensive tackle don’t transfer to much of anything else out in the real world and so preparing\\n00:50:00 to do something beyond football was really important. And law school was that preparation.\\nJH: Right. So you graduate from law school and you graduate and —you graduate and—what’s the timing there? You still play for a little bit after you graduate?\\nAP: I played three and a half more years.\\nJH: Three and a half more years and so you’re—\\nAP: Seventy-eight; seventy-nine [1979]. Four more years.\\nJH: Okay. During that time, then, you graduate, you’re playing, but then you start at Lindquist and Vennum [Lindquist \\u0026 Vennum, offices in Minnesota, Colorado, and South Dakota; formed in 1968 when Lindquist, Magnuson \\u0026 Glennon combined with Vennum, Newhall, Ackman \\u0026 Goetz. As of January 1, 2018, the firm merged with and took the name of Ballard Spahr]. So what’s the practice there like? Tell me about that a little bit.\\nAP: It’s trying to figure out who you are as a lawyer. And it’s, you know, getting assignments and, you know, Here’s the file. Go do this. And it’s like, How do you go do this? (laughter)\\nJH: A little more explanation.\\nAP: Would be helpful. It wasn’t always forthcoming. Sort of get thrown into the thick of things and there were some horrible, awful, very bad moments where I had no idea what I was doing but had to try to figure it out while I was doing it.\\nJH: Enjoyable though?\\nAP: Not especially. 13\\nJH: No?\\nAP: One of the things I figured out early on about the private practice of law, it’s about business; it’s about billing hours and that just—it never—that is not me. My interest in the law was the law and trying to sort of work through it, sort it out and figure it out and come to the best conclusions that you can. And when you’ve got this little thing sitting on your shoulder talking about billable hours, first of all, you’re distracted by that because you’re thinking, Hey, am I billing enough hours and how do I justify these hours? And so from that standpoint, it was not necessarily pleasant.\\nThat said, I got to work with some really good lawyers and like every other new lawyer, Can you do a memo for me on this? And you give them the memo and it comes back and it’s like, I didn’t know there was that much red ink in the world. (laughter)\\nJH: But lessons, then, as well, I suppose, too, right, so you’re—\\nAP: Absolutely.\\nJH: it’s a big learning curve but you’re learning a lot.\\nAP: But you’re learning a lot. That’s where I got grounded and so from that standpoint, it was a very valuable experience but just not my idea of a good time. And I was fortunate enough to make my way to the attorney general’s office and I loved it there because Skip Humphrey [Hubert Horatio \\\"Skip\\\" Humphrey III (June 26, 1942-)] was the attorney general and he let the lawyers who were there to do the work, do the work. And let me learn to give my best legal advice to my clients. Didn’t have to worry about billing hours; didn’t have to worry about clients walking away. I could do the best that I could to figure out what is the best—what is the law and what is the best advice I can give this client? And I could do that and there’s a lot of freedom in that and I absolutely loved it.\\n00:55:00 JH: Did you have a particular focus in the attorney general’s office?\\nAP: Labor and employment.\\nJH: You were? Okay.\\nAP: Labor and employment.\\nJH: And you enjoyed that?\\nAP: And that’s what I did at Lindquist also on the employee side and just flipped to the employer side.\\nJH: So you’re working at the Minnesota Attorney General’s office four years, five years-ish, something like that? 14\\nAP: Started in ’85, the first week of January, 1985, and left the last week of December in 1992.\\nJH: Okay, so, yeah. So when do you start thinking about—maybe not even necessarily the Minnesota Supreme Court but the idea of doing something different and maybe that being judging?\\nAP: You know, I had this weird experience. In 1982, I’m at Lindquist and Vennum and—’82 or ’83—and I wake up one morning and the newspaper has an article about Governor Perpich [Rudolph George Perpich Sr. (June 27, 1928–September 21, 1995)] is going to appoint some new judges and he’s got my name on the list. Nobody had asked.\\nJH: Interesting.\\nAP: It was very strange but up until that point it hadn’t really occurred to me a) that I would have the interest in being a judge or that I could be, or that I had the skills or temperament. Long story short, made me think about it. And, you know, through that time, I’m learning who I am as a lawyer; what my skills are; what my interests are; and what my strengths and weaknesses are. And over time, I sort of start thinking, Maybe there is something in the judiciary that would fit me, but I can’t see myself necessarily as a trial court judge. And, you know, as lawyers we spend a lot of time reading opinions and struggling to figure out what they mean. And thinking, Well, if they meant this, why didn’t they just say it? Why is it so hard to say in plain clear language what you mean?\\nAnd of course, my ego says to myself, Self, you could do that. You could write clearly. You could write concisely and so over time I start to think my skills and my interests, my abilities, my strengths lend themselves to what appellate court judges do. And from there, well, how does one become an appellate court judge? Well, as you know in Minnesota, it’s either by appointment or by election. And the Minnesota Court of Appeals is new, relatively new, and most of the judges there or many of the judges there had been trial court judges, so that seems like a natural step even though the trial court isn’t necessarily what fits me. And so I started applying for trial court judge positions and had absolutely no success.\\n01:00:00 Eventually I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t going to have any success and that, if I\\nwanted the opportunity to serve, it was probably going to be through election, which narrows things down to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.\\nJH: Right.\\nAP: And my thought process was, Well, if you’re going to seek election, you might as well seek election to the Minnesota Supreme Court. I think I have something to contribute. I think, both from a legal background, but also from just a different perspective, and so, 1990, I decided to seek election. And when the filing period opened, I was down there first morning, first hour, filed for election and the justice who I was going to challenge; thought I was going to challenge, resigned before I got out of the secretary of state’s office. 15\\nJH: Oh wow.\\nAP: Which created a vacancy. Vacancies are filled by appointment. The governor immediately appointed someone to fill the vacancy and the election for that seat no longer existed. And I, in seeking election, it wasn’t about the individual justice who I was going to challenge; it wasn’t about their opinions or their philosophy or their anything else; it was simply—it seemed to me to be a fair question given that the justice was going to reach mandatory retirement within something less than six months of re-election and it was a fair question, at least I thought, to have the people of Minnesota decide who they would want to serve the term.\\nMe, a known quantity, a known person, or some unknown, ultimately some unknown person. The election was taken off the ballot and, you know, it wasn’t clear to me why, you know. Being a person of color, one of the things that comes to mind is, Is it because I’m a person of color? Is it politics? Is it—I don’t know—let that go; continued working at the attorney general’s office and decided to try again in 1992.\\nThis time, the justice I sought to challenge, was going to reach mandatory retirement within about eighteen months of the full six-year term and I thought again it was fair question to have the people of Minnesota decide who the justice should be who serves in that seat. Before I could get to the—before the filings opened, we had this provision in our constitution which provides for the retirement of the judges and there is a statute which provided, also provides to carry out that constitutional provision, which provided that the governor could extend\\n01:05:00 the term of a justice who hadn’t reached full retirement at the time they were up for re-\\nelection and with mandatory retirement approaching. And so Justice Yetka [Lawrence R. Yetka (October 1, 1924–November 12, 2017)] who was the justice who I was going to challenge, sought a term extension; the governor granted it and I was, to say the least, more than a little frustrated.\\nAnd so, long story short, I commenced a lawsuit against the governor and the secretary of state, a lawsuit that had its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court and a number of people told me I was crazy, that you’re wrong on the law; you’re wrong on the politics and you’re never, you know, when you lose this lawsuit, you’re never, ever going to have the opportunity to serve.\\nI felt strongly about one, that the, as applied, the term extension violated the constitution. I wasn’t much concerned about the politics because I’d been—sort of along the way I’d figured out you have to do what you think is right, not what is expedient, and turns out I was right on the law; we were right on the law. And I was given the opportunity, along with anybody else who wanted to file for election for the seat. I filed; Justice Yetka did not and two other people did and almost immediately, not almost immediately, immediately, my opponents started down the road of, He's just a football player. And initially, implicit, but unstated, he’s just a dumb football player. Also initially, but not necessarily subsequently, but initially, he’s just a dumb, black football player. I mean, that was the tenor of what was being said. He’s not qualified. 16\\nI spent the next three months, three and a half months, whatever it is, campaigning around the state to talk about why I wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. What I could bring what I had to offer about my experience and my background and my qualifications. And at every turn, I got the accusatory question, What are your qualifications? And nobody else was being asked that. And so that was difficult. That said, it was also satisfying to be able to talk to people about who I am and what I thought I had to offer and in the end, the people of this state gave\\n01:10:00 me the opportunity to serve. They elected me. I am humbled, honored. I have a hard time\\narticulating how meaningful it is to me that they saw through the effort to stereotype me; that they saw in me somebody who hopefully, had something to contribute and they gave me the opportunity to do it.\\nJH: Was—so, you know, you mentioned that, in terms of the campaign, questions about qualification, but implicit questions about—\\nAP: Race.\\nJH: what it means to be an athlete—race. Was diversity, and the fact that, if elected, you’d be the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice: Was that a part of that conversation explicitly or was that not really a part of that discussion?\\nAP: That wasn’t a part of the discussion.\\nJH: So you’re elected.\\nAP: And I show up the first day.\\nJH: What’s the first day like?\\nAP: Well, I had a month before, I’d been given briefs for the—\\nJH: Get to work.\\nAP: Yes, for the argument calendar in January of ’93, and initially I had been assigned a case that was being heard that first day.\\nJH: Okay.\\nAP: Mind you, I had—I didn’t know how the system worked, right?\\nJH: Right. The norms, the processes—\\nAP: The norms, the processes, any of it. And so I’m fast tracking, trying to figure all this out and it turns out the case that they gave me, I had a conflict. Phew! So they switched cases and gave me one for the second day. I was getting my baptism by fire. I, you know, read the briefs, prepared—didn’t know what—and for my case the second day, as you know, we do a 17\\nreport to the court, I’d never done a report to the court because I hadn’t been on the court. But I had to sort of figure that out but I had no sort of context for doing that. And the—I was sworn in before the first argument the first day and we were having a public ceremony after it.\\nJH: That very first day.\\nAP: That very first day, public swearing in.\\nJH: There were some distractions beyond the work of the court.\\nAP: One or two. And sat through the one argument because I was recused on the other but sat through my first case conference and learned what a report was like. Do the public swearing in ceremony; celebrate with family, and at the end of the day, get that report written.\\nJH: And that report on your mind kind of throughout the day a little bit?\\nAP: Oh, absolutely.\\nJH: Yeah, I got to get that report; I’ve got some work to do.\\nAP: I’ve got some work to do. At least now I know what it is. And the second day I had\\n01:15:00 my—we had the two cases I sat through, gave my report and that’s the way it begins. We\\ndon’t do that anymore. At least when I left the court, new justices had some time to learn the system.\\nJH: So was that a, I mean, do you think back on the first—beyond the first day or two, the first week; the first month, as I said, because it was trial by fire a little bit right away that it was an easy transition? I mean, hard by the way, but a quick one or—?\\nAP: Invigorating, and a very quick transition. You know, as with anything new, particularly in the world of work, you don’t know the rules and the norms until you violate them and so you’re trying to figure it all out and, you know, you have your missteps along the way but you figure it out and, as with many things, the question isn’t whether you made the mistake, but what did you learn from it. In this particular instance, I had to be a quick learner and I was.\\nJH: Absolutely.\\nAP: And then, you know, you get that first case behind you, the argument and the report, and then you’ve got to write—\\nJH: You’ve got some more work to do. It’s not over.\\nAP: And having never written an opinion before, you have to learn how to do that.\\nJH: Which is a whole other beast in and of itself. 18\\nAP: Absolutely, but I had a good law clerk, Ian Nemiroff, who helped me a lot. He helped me a lot. And as over the years, I had a bunch of great clerks who made me look good time and time again.\\nJH: I wanted to ask about clerks, not in a selfish way, but it’s definitely a part of your work on the court, daily work on the court. What did you look for in a clerk?\\nAP: I looked for people who were curious; people who had something in their background that was out of the norm. Justice Gardebring [Sandra Gardebring Ogren (June 14, 1947–July 20, 2010)] used to refer to what she called Standard Issue Law Students, SILS (laughter). I didn’t want Standard Issue Law clerks. I wanted people who—obviously you want somebody that can write; you want somebody that’s going to work hard. But you want somebody who’s going to have good judgment and a sense of curiosity to sort of look under the rocks that need to be looked under and not under the ones that don’t and who can figure that out pretty quickly. And who are willing to or who were willing to tell me when I was wrong. I didn’t need a law clerk or law clerks who would tell me what I want to hear. I don’t like surprises and so, when I’m working with a clerk, I want the clerk to make sure there are no surprises.\\nJH: Right.\\nAP: And I was pretty lucky along the way—a bunch of great writers, yourself included; hard workers; curiosity—you fit the bill nicely.\\nJH: Well, it’s—I always talk about, too. It’s one of those incredible experiences where you get out of law school and then the work, in many ways, it feels like some of the most\\n01:20:00 important work that you’ll do as an attorney, working on the court so pretty incredible\\nexperience.\\nSo talk about—I recall in the year in your office—\\nAP: I should also note, I wanted diversity in my clerks. I wanted women; I wanted clerks who were people of color; I wanted diversity in their, you know, where they came from; what their experiences were—because all of that makes; all of that enriches the process and makes what I do as a judge better having different views, different ways of looking at things and I mean, I think that’s vital.\\nJH: Your approach to tackling an opinion. I remember you taking, I think, a lot of joy in peeling apart the layers, finding the resolution, and obviously, as you’ve said many times before, none of the cases that come before the Minnesota Supreme Court are simple. They’re there because they’re complex. Talk about that a little bit.\\nAP: They’re there because they’re complex; they’re there because they’re important to the people involved in them, no matter who they are, whether it’s a—the fifth petition for review from a post-conviction inmate, or, you know, some large corporation, it’s important to the people that we serve. It’s important to the people of the state that we do it well and that we do 19\\nit as right as we can. And I—opinion writing is—on any given day I will tell you it’s more art than science or that it’s more science than art.\\nJH: Right.\\nAP: It’s really a combination of both and for me, it was very important to work with the word so that what the opinion said was clear, easily understood, easily read and helpful. And to do that for me, it was about making sure that there were no unintended words, much less unintended ideas but no unintended words that—every word was thought about; that every word was where it was in the sentence because that’s the best use of the word in communicating the idea that you’re trying to communicate. That every sentence in the paragraph was where it was because that was the best way to communicate what you were trying to communicate in the paragraph. That every paragraph in the opinion was where it was because that’s where it was most helpful.\\n01:25:00 I suspect that you clerks probably thought I was a little obsessive and maybe even a little\\ncompulsive but certainly obsessive about words, how we used the language, but that was important to me; that was very important to me.\\nJH: I remember you talked right away about the purpose of every word. If it doesn’t have a role; if it’s not there for a reason,\\nAP: Gone.\\nJH: Get it out.\\nAP: If it doesn’t have a reason, it’s not helping anybody. All it does is add length and the potential for confusion.\\nJH: And the potential for interpretation differently than the intent was.\\nAP: Different than what you intended.\\nJH: Right, I remember that lesson. It sticks with me for sure. I was always struck with the collegiality and rapport on the court. You know, it was a serious place; a lot of important work, but I also remember, at least feeling like, the justices had a lot of respect for one another and were good friends as well. Can you speak to that a little bit?\\nAP: Well, you know, it’s interesting. You have seven people, and changing all the time, who have big brains; who would like to think they’re the smartest one in the room; who have views that conflict and who feel strongly about their opinions. But we’ve been lucky here in Minnesota to have people understand that the institution is more important than any one of us and institutionally, it is important to maintain that collegiality, even when your colleagues, in your view, are so far wrong that you can’t understand how they could possibly be there. And sometimes the tension is pretty high but in the end you have to understand that a.) it’s about the institution and the work; it’s not about me. And also, you have to understand that, you 20\\nknow, some day you may need that colleague to get where you want to go in a particular case or where you think a case should go.\\nWhen I first got on the court I would hear these stories about what was going on in other states with their Supreme Courts. Justices inviting one another out into the corridor to have a fight; justices showing up at conference and placing a handgun on the conference table. How does that work? How can you have a justice system that—or that the members of which of\\n01:30:00 their courts are so antagonistic with one another that they can’t be civil even, you know, under\\npressure? How do you reach good decisions doing that? I don’t think you can. One of the things that was also, I think, important for our court during my time there, to ensure the understanding that collegiality was important and that it’s the institution, it’s not us, was that we, in our conference, you know, there are seven of us. We know each other by first name. We refer to each other as Justice So and So, just to make it clear in our own minds and everybody else in the room, that this is an institutional decision we’re making. This is the institution that is acting; it’s not me, Alan Page, making a decision. I’m making it on behalf of this institution. And it’s a way to sort of force you to treat people with respect and I think it served us well.\\nJH: Those small things are not small things.\\nAP: Not small at all.\\nJH: Right.\\nAP: Not small at all.\\nJH: Right. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the first—the critical first of being the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice? Sort of looking back and thinking about the role of that first in your work on the court?\\nAP: I have a hard time doing that because that wasn’t what it was about. Institutionally, I think it’s important that there had to be a first. Institutionally, it would have been better had it been somebody long before me. The fact that it finally happened—that we finally opened the door if you will for people of color, I think it was very significant. I think equally significant was the fact that when I joined the court, the court was a majority of women.\\nJH: That’s right.\\nAP: People would ask me, What’s it like serving on the court with a majority of women, right? And, of course, having not served on a court that wasn’t a majority of women, I thought, Well, that’s the natural order of things. But those things are important—that our judicial—that people who serve in our judicial system reflect the people of this state. I’ve said many times that the only power that courts have is founded in the trust and confidence of the people we serve and the less the members of the judiciary look like the people they serve, the less trust and confidence our judiciary will have. And so I think finally breaking that barrier was critically important. 21\\n01:35:00 JH: Right. On that note, I mean, early on in your tenure as a justice—and I want to get this\\nright—your service on the Minnesota Supreme Court Task Force on Racial Bias in the Judicial System. Report’s issued in 1993.\\nAP: Six months after I joined the court.\\nJH: Right. And you were involved.\\nAP: Well, I—\\nJH: Can you just describe that a little bit or what was your participation; what was your experience?\\nAP: I became the chair of the committee that was going to implement the task force report. That was challenging for me. Remember my interest in the law was the law and not in being an administrator? And so from that standpoint, a lot of the things that, not only that committee, but we all—we had various committee assignments. I have to say those committee assignments were not my favorite part of being on the court.\\nBut this was an important one and, you know, we ended up working through the—depending on how you count them—the one hundred plus recommendations, pretty much most of them being implemented. But—and the implementation made things better but it didn’t solve the problem. It was a little—I think we made very incremental progress. But the disparities that came out of the report, particularly in the criminal justice area, where African-Americans, people of color are arrested more often; stopped more often; charged more often; given higher bail; less fair trials; higher conviction rates; longer sentences; all things being equal, that hasn’t ended and that’s just on the criminal justice side. There’s the juvenile justice and all the other aspects of the report.\\nI’ve more or less come to the conclusion that before real change is going to happen, we have to take a more fundamental look at what our law is grounded in, which is to say, it’s grounded in a constitution that counted those imported as slaves as three-fifths of a person. And while we’ve had the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments ending slavery, ensuring due process and guaranteeing the right to vote, the law itself, the foundation, is still on cases that arose out of slavery and we’ve got to figure out how to tease that out of it before we have fundamental change.\\nJH: Structural fundamental change, right?\\n01:40:00 AP: It’s a structural, systemic problem.\\nJH: What about, Justice Page, any notable opinions; dissents; anything come to mind? You wrote a lot so it’s a big body of work but—?\\n22\\nAP: I have never, in my own head, quantified or qualified whether it was a dissent or an opinion in terms of its importance. It seems to me that once you do that; once you decide that this one is more important than that one, you start doing both of them a disservice. And so I just took each one as they came and tried to put the same energy and effort into trying to get it right. And again, as I say, whether it was that fifth post-conviction petition, or, you know, some mega million dollar corporate issue, the people who come before us deserve to have our fullest attention and so I just don’t qualify them, quantify them in that way.\\nJH: Don’t think of it as that, right? So, during your tenure on the court, one thing I wanted to ask you about, too, is just sort of the interplay, if you think of there being one at all, between your continued community engagement and still working on the court. You know, we would—I think back a lot on going and reading with you and other staff in the court, reading to elementary school kids on Wednesdays or whatever day it was. That community engagement and, you know, did that play a role in your work in your works as a justice? Did you see it sort of separately or was it related and did it inform your work?\\nAP: Oh, I think everything we do -- our lives inform our work. I don’t know that I, you know, my reading with kids or my involvement to the extent that I had it, which was quite limited at the Page Education Foundation, influenced my work directly but it’s a part of who I am and being engaged in the community around us at some level helps us understand those people we are a part of but also who we represent. And I think it would be a mistake to be isolated and not a part of the world around us to the extent, obviously, to the extent possible, to the extent that it doesn’t create conflicts.\\nJH: You’ve had some time now after retiring, I suppose to think back. Any, I guess maybe the question is, in thinking about it and this kind of gets to some final reflections about your time on the court, it’s a big question, but what is it—personally and professionally—can you put into words what the service meant to you?\\nAP: Well, for me, it was the most, in terms of my professional life, the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. The challenges of working with seven other people. I mean, I looked forward to every day when I was on the court, particularly to those days where we would hear argument and have conferences because every conference you got stretched in ways that you would never get stretched and I loved that. Trying to understand what your colleagues are saying and thinking; trying to understand what you were thinking in the context of what they are saying and thinking and trying to understand what you were thinking.\\nJH: Work through thought processes, right.\\nAP: And working through all that doesn’t get any better.\\nJH: Sometimes arriving at unexpected places, too?\\nAP: Oh, all the time, all the time. Arriving at unexpected places; arriving at places that, on a personal level, you wouldn’t want to arrive at. You—if I could decide this on my own, this is not what I would do, but not my choice, you know. One of the—a little bit disconcerting 23\\nthings about our society—is I don’t think people understand how important it is for judges to be impartial and to exercise their judgment and not impose their will. And just the challenge of doing that all the time and trying to get that right, it’s all very much fun; very invigorating; very satisfying. And, hopefully, in the end, I did it as well as I could do it. I leave that up to others to decide but that was certainly my goal and I enjoyed every minute of it along the way.\\nJH: What about the future of the court? You’re not on it, obviously, anymore, but thinking about challenges, hopes; any thoughts come to mind about the future?\\nAP: My hope would be that they continue to be independent; that they continue to act impartially and understand that it is about the exercise of judgment and if the court’s members can do that it’ll have a bright future. And there’s something about, at least from my experience on the court looking back and looking forward, I think there’s a pretty good chance that things will continue in that regard as they have.\\nThe court’s leadership understands. I had the good fortune to serve with, let me think—I knew the number exactly at one time. Let’s see—one, two three—I can’t remember the exact number—six or seven or eight—\\n01:50:00 JH: Chief justices?\\nAP: chief justices and each one of them got it. They were all different but each one of them understood how important it is for our court to maintain its independence and its impartiality and to make decisions based on the law and the facts and their best judgment and not on the way the wind is blowing today. We’ve been lucky to have really good people, both at the chief justice, as chief justices, and as associate justices and I, to be included in that group is pretty special.\\nJH: You know, I want to definitely, before we close out, give you an opportunity to speak to your late wife Diane’s [Diane Sims Page (1944-September 30, 2018)], role in your career.\\nAP: Well, I mentioned earlier about that forty thousand dollars I lost on the vending machines?\\nJH: Yeah, that’s right.\\nAP: The company that owned the vending machines was a subsidiary of General Mills.\\nJH: I know where this is going now.\\nAP: And, long story short, I was in the lobby at General Mills one day, having left the meeting and left my car keys and everything else in the meeting and I’m sitting, waiting for somebody to bring them back to me and Diane walks into a meeting that she was going to there. I got introduced to her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Absolutely the best thing that ever happened to me. She is the love of my life; she kept me grounded at the same time lifting me up. She had this magic ability to lift people up, no matter who they 24\\nwere; no matter what the circumstances were. She had incredible insight into people and she is in large measure the key to much of the success that I’ve had. She was there every step of the way, allowing me, encouraging me, supporting me. And, as I say, I couldn’t have been luckier to have met her, fallen in love with her and spent the years that we had together. And she was one of those people who—I have ideas. She was a doer.\\nJH: Executor.\\nAP: Absolutely, and it wasn’t, you know, When are you going to get this done? It’s, Why wasn’t this done yesterday? Well, because we just found out that we had to do it today. She was in a sense, driven and driven to do good; driven to make this world a better place, that’s for sure. And I got lucky.\\n01:55:00 JH: Well, you have retired from the court but you’re busy.\\nAP: I am busy.\\nJH: And so I’ve got to ask, what’s next? What’s next for Justice Page?\\nAP: Well, there’s still plenty of work to do with the Page Education Foundation and beyond that, I’m trying to figure out what I’m going to do when I grow up. I haven’t sorted that out yet but I spend a lot of time in schools and classrooms still, talking to young children. As you know, I’ve had the good fortune to be able to write three children’s books with my youngest daughter and we’ve got to get on to book four.\\nJH: I was going to ask; that was my next question.\\nAP: We’ve got to get on to book four.\\nJH: More work to be done.\\nAP: More work to be done.\\nJH: And Justice Page Middle School? I mean, it seems you spend time—I see pictures and things and you’re really engaged with the school.\\nAP: I am engaged with the school. The school is magic. You know, sixth, seventh, eighth graders—they energize me still. They keep me going. And I also have four grandchildren that do the same thing.\\nJH: Being a grandfather, a job in and of itself.\\nAP: Yes.\\nJH: Well, I think that’s a good place to close. Unless you have any other thoughts. We’ve had a good conversation so thanks for sharing your insights today. And thank you, I think in 25\\nthinking about this conversation through the arc from beginning to end and the focus on the Minnesota Supreme Court, I want to and then I thank and we all want to thank you for your service on the Supreme Court, too.\\nAP: Well, thank you for that, but I can’t articulate how much I loved serving on the court and being able to serve the people of this state. I can’t articulate how honored I am that the people of this state gave me the opportunity to do it and I don’t know—well, let me just back up. You know, one of the humbling things about serving is you’re there; you’re working on cases and you’re looking at cases from 1860, trying to figure out what the law is today because it’s grounded in something that took place back then. The idea that cases that I worked on when I was on the court will be used one hundred fifty, two hundred years from now, that the law will be grounded in something that I was a part of during my tenure, it’s almost overwhelming.\\nJH: It’s an awesome thought.\\nAP: I just hope that I didn’t goof it up so that hopefully what I did; what we did when I was on the court will make their jobs easier.\\nJH: Sure. A good note to end on.\\nAP: Thank you.\\nJH: Thank you, appreciate it. It was good to talk to you Justice Page.\\nAP: Good to see you, Jeff.\\nEnd of Recording\\n02:00:18 \",\"transl\":{},\"fullrs\":{},\"find\":\"22548.pdf\",\"dmaccess\":{},\"dmimage\":{},\"dmcreated\":\"2021-05-17\",\"dmmodified\":\"2021-05-17\",\"dmoclcno\":{},\"dmrecord\":\"22547\",\"restrictionCode\":\"1\",\"cdmfilesize\":\"231205\",\"cdmfilesizeformatted\":\"0.22 MB\",\"cdmprintpdf\":\"0\",\"cdmhasocr\":\"0\",\"cdmisnewspaper\":\"0\",\"page\":[],\"id\":\"sll/22547\"}]"
