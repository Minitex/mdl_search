This is an interview with Naomi Silfversten, and Ruth Silfversten Coppins,\npetty Hamspen, Ruth and Naomi are sisters and they grew up in the West End of\nDuluth and your father's name was Carl J. Silfversten.\nCan you give me a background on where your father and mother were born and how\nthey came to this country?\nMy father was born in the Swedish section or part of Finland and the town was Narpes,\nFinland. Mother was born in Sweden, Skane. (with an umlaut, I think.)\nMother's name?\nEllen Benson.\nWilen were they born?\nM9ther was born in 1883. I remember that. Because she was 95 just about 96 when she died\nand that was in 1979.\nWas your father older than your mother?\nYes, about 4 years or so - so 1879.\nThey immigrated - stories?\nWell, Dad was 19 years old when he came here and he wanted to go into the ministry\neventually so he had to go to school and I believe he probably came from Rock Island or that\narea and I don't know much about the - after 19 I suppose he had to get - he had an education\nin Finland and they came here because he did get to Gustavus Adolphus College and from\nthere he went to Theological Seminary; that was in Rockford. This is where he met Mother as\nshe was a member ofthe church and the choir and they were married.\nDid he tell you about life in Finland?\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 2\nNo but - well I'm quite sure he was a poor child and like so many immigrants because they\nwanted to get a better - have a better life so he was interested in becoming a minister and this\nwas his goal to come to this country to study.\nWas his father a minister?\nNo, his father was a captain ofthe high seas or a fisherman - a commercial fisherman on the\ngulfof 01 so Dad was sort of raised to be a fisherman when he was a child so Dad has\nwritten several books but he has that one that is a safe channel that he writes stories regarding\nthe - ofthe days with his dad fishing.\nI am pretty sure I have that at home.\nI have that one too. And I don't have much on my mother's background. Apparently she was\njust a baby when she came here to this country.\nSo your father was a Swede-Finn?\nDad always said Finland Swede and - Swedes are born iii Finland and which is - I had made\na trip there- it would be ten years this year and I visited the area where Dad was from and it's\non the west coast - the GulfofB.? -and I don't know how many towns or cities are included\nin all ofthe west coast but it does go up quite a ways and I don't have that map with me. It's\nFinland and all outside on the west coast ofFinland.\nIt was settled by Swedish people?\nYes.\nFinnish government?\nI suppose they had to be. Part ofthe time they were undertheRussian - in 1917 then Finland\ndeclared its independence.\nWere they amongst Swedish speaking people?\nOh yes the whole area is. Jim was on that trip too.\nWhen your father came here did he come by himself?\nI understand that.\nAny relatives?\nNot that I'm aware of. Not that we know.\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project .\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 3\nWe had relatives way up in T., He didn't come over the same time she did and\nwhether she was born over there or in this country - I don't know. That is the only known\nrelative I can think of.\nWhen did he come here?\n1819.\nWhat did he do when he first came here?\nI suppose he had to go on in school, I don't know ifhe completed high school in Finland so\ncalled- he probably did but then he went to Gustavus College in the summer he used to - in\nfact he came to Duluth. I remember him telling us in 1905 and he worked on the coal docks\nin order to get some money for school and at that time he also - he didn't join but he would\ngo to the Bethany Lutheran church in West End and I think he taught Saturday Bible School­something\nlike that and ~ but and then from then he ofcourse\nWhen did he meet your mother?\nWhen they probably came to S.? in that area. I don't know much about them landing here. I\nknow that she was - well he was at this church in Chicago because she was from Chicago and\nhe met her at church naturally because he was interested in becoming a minister and she­mother\nwas in the choir and so apparently the romance started that way and so they were\nmarried and then - married in Chicago.\nSo he graduated from Gustavus and went on to Augustana Seminary in Rock Island, IL.\nGraduated?\nIt must have been 1909 because it seemed to me they were married in 1909.... Church? The\nfirst church he was assigned to was in Worchester, Massachusetts, and then from there they\nmoved to Gladstone, ML He was a SwedishlFinland minister. He had these churches that\nwere Swede/Finn origin and then went to Gladstone, ML, went to Ironwood, Michigan, then\nto Rhinelander, WI and then ofcourse in 1920 he was called here to Bethel,\nDid he stay in Duluth?\nYes until he passed away. He was the pastor ofthis church for 26 years.\nWhere were you guys born?\nI was born in Ironwood.\nI was born in Rhinelander and our brother was born in Gladstone.\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Rnth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 4\nWhat is your brother's name?\nHilden?? And of course she was a twin and the other brother passed away when he was 19\nmonths old.\nThen the family moved to Duluth and that is where all-\nThere was - this church had a parsonage down the block here and - so that. is where we were\nfor a period oftime. I don't remember how long because at that time Dad decided he wanted\nto build his own home so he got some property up on Central Avenue so - but at that time\nmother took ill and she was an invalid from the time she was 40 years old until she died in\n1995. But nevertheless we managed to get along. They sold the parsonage and then we\nmoved down to 53\" this way temporarily until our house became livable or we could move\nin. So that is where we spent most ofour time.\nWhat do you remember about your ethnic group?\nI don't recall what we singled out -we chummed around with anyone and everybody. We\nhad different nationalities. I can't say that we singled out the Swedes or Finns. A great part of\nour time was spent here at church. When we went to school or out to play it was all\nnationalities. But I think that we had a normal growing up as anybody else. Except that we\nwere the minister's kids and you felt you had to be so good because your father was a\nminister.\nIt is a lot different now. Even the ministers are different. It's kind ofnice because - you're\nsomething a little special. I don't know ifthey felt that way or not. We lived a normal life.\n------:-----Htilro.-.wVlfabhOlrurrtt-allJ1mniiinnmisltt\u003c\u003eerr\"'s-Ufe in those days?-----------------------\nVisit sick people, that is part oftheir ministers in the homes or in the hospital and he had to\nattend a lot of different meetings with other ministers and they had to go out oftown and the\nconference meetings and things like that. Dad was not interested in sports or anything but he\nloved to fish so any time that he could get up to Boulder Lake or Fish Lake or sometime I\nremember being with him a couple oftimes and he was very patient and we just sat all day in\nthe boat.\nI remember going on part ofhis vacation with him once because he went up to Eagles' Nest\nLake and he had fixed the car the back seat - the back part ofthe seat so they would go down\nand you could sleep in the car and I remember being up there with him for several days with\nhim and I don't remember how old 1 was but I remember-\nHe loved to fish.\nI remember also one time he fished at Islaud Lake and the blinding snow storm on the first\nfishing day ofthe season May 15 so here we are in January thinking ofwhat we might have\nto look forward to.\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPageS\nHow would you describe a typical week for a miuister?\nChurch, church. Oh well yes and his daughters and son spent all of our time here. We used to\nhave three services on Sunday: a Swedish, and English, and a Swedish at night and we three\nkids so caIled we all had to take our turns at being the organist -we alI had training - we all\nhad lessons of course piano and organ so brother first because he was older and then I went\non to nurses' training and my sister, Ruth. So we alI had to spend lots oftime here and lots of\ntime then we would have prayer meetings on Wednesday we had to be here. Friday was choir\npractice because then we had to take care ofthe choir and then the three services on Sunday.\nOfcourse Saturday was confirmation and for whatever. We had willing workers and I\nremember we had it in that second room especially when it was real cold and Dad would put\nfire in that little stove so we huddled around that.\nIs this the organ?\nThat's the organ -that's the one we played.\nSo you were the center of attention?\nWell, we didn't have a choice; put it that way.\nAny stories?\nI can't remember but like I say it's a little different now with pastors' families. Kids speak up\nmore than - I belong to Pilgrim Lutheran church in Superior and I have been there ever since\n---------I've-bllen-marrilld-m1d-so-I've-been-going-as-member~nd_I-knew-the-family-life-is-a-little-bitt-----­different\nthan they were when Naomi and my brother and I grew up here. But that was the\ntimes; everything has changed. And one thing I have to say that I am proud to say that I was\nbrought up in the minister's home. I am very happy that that time-\nEven ifthey were so strict. Mother wasn't but Dad ofcourse -he ruled the roost, I can tell\nyou.\nWas he a strict miuister?\nWeIl, it wasn't fire and brimstone, I don't think. He had some good sermons. You know-\nWas the church a place where somebody was coming from Sweden - did they come to\nthe church in those early days?\nWe did have quite a few people that came over from Finland and find our church. I think it\nwas mostly the men who came and some ofthem went back and some didn't go back to\nFinland.\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 6\nOftenwe had visitors to cometo the church; guess wherethey stayed overnight. We would be\nroutedout ofour cribs or bedsto take care ofsome other ministerthat is comingto visit. But\nit didn't hurt us.\nDid you get late night phone calls of death in someone's family?\nI don't recall muchofthat. Dadhad a studyand -\nOnething about himthat - he quite oftenhe was up in the middle ofthe night andthen he\nwould go downto the kitchenand cookand drinkhis coffeeand study and write sermonsand\nof coursehe did write somebookstoo but that is whenhe did his thinking becausehe said it\nwas always more quiet in the houseduringthe nightthan it was duringthe day whenwe were\naround. Quiet, quietdownthere.\nWas he a prolific writer?\nYes he was. Hehad outlinesbecauseI think I have somestill at home- someoutlinesand ­he\nwouldpreach fromthem.\nHe wrote a book?\nYes I happenedto - I haven't had time to - I have all these and I have to get this all together\n- the Finland Swedes in America; this is it. It waspublished in 1931 and it is all here\ntranslatedto the English languagebut howI received these was through the Swede-Finn\nHistorical Societyand there referredto the Finland Swedes had a lodge and they are still\nactive out west- Bruneberg Lodgeandthe Bruneberg Lodgeof Seattle is then there - they\nhad publications calledthe LeadingStaror in Swedish? but - so the editor of that paper,\n---------I\\}oug Hansen,we were in touch or contactandhe said that we WIll seethat youget the\npublication and this is of course I wouldtake it out likethis and so there is 26 chapters. It was\na big book;just by lookingat all of this you can see what our fatherwas doingin the middle\nofthe night besidewriting for sermons andthis wasn't the only book.\nDid he ever tell you why?\nOh,he was so proud ofhis peopleand he felt it andthen of coursehe traveledto get some\n. information for the book.He went out west andthere are quitea few Finland Swedes in that\narea, and California and out in Michigan and Mass. Andalso Australia; there are a lot of\nFinns and Swedes. Sothis is what I say; he reallydid quitea bit of-\nHe knew of the other people who were working the church; is that where he got the\ninformation?\nIpresume he got that throughmanypeopleand I think towardthe end here the several people\nthat menthat were influenced him andthat is wherehe got informationfrom.\nHe wrote that in Swedish?\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Rnth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJannary 29, 1998\nPage 7\nYes, in Swedish.\nWas he in the lodge?\nWe - I think we were members for a while. W.e weren't lodge people; we never had been.\nThere wasn't any reason to. It was a sick benefit.\nWas there a chapter here in Duluth?\nThey had many years ago but they had it - there were two up on the range also.\nWhat other books did he write?\nI have sent a couple ofours out there. Well we know \"Safe Channels\" aud then \"My\nHome... \" and I don't remember the translation ofthe rest of it. I don't have the list with me\nthat I sent to the Historical Society.\nDid he perform a lot of weddings?\nI imagine he did at one time; it was a very busy church and congregation. And so he it was a\nlot ofactivity in this church.\nHow many members?\n200 or so. Maybe when they were at the peak time might have been.\nWas this church built when he arrived?\nYes, it was. Yes, because there were other ministers here before Dad came. Pastor Oberg was\nhere. Kastlin? was here at that time.\nYou said there were 200 or 300 people and you had church services and choir practices;\nwere there other social things and choir practices?\nWe had dinners and church suppers - oh yes, and we eveb had lutefisk suppers and trout\nsuppers - must say something right at this popoibnt, too,that dad organized a church out in\nfrench river - a church oput there - he felt the need - beind Dad was so interested infishing\nand all he fel the need along the shore out there and then found out they were Finland­Swedes\nand that there was quite a number ofthem - maybe, it was kind ofa mission church\nat the time out there so he did organizethat too. They built after a while but the fi5rst so­called\nservices were held in the homes - and then after that they did buid a church up on the\nRyan road and that was there until they decided - I'm trying to thiuk ofthe date - 51 or 2­52\nand then they had ground-breaking for the new church onRyan road that's there now - so\nit's an active church.\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 8\nAnother pastor?\nNo, he was the pastor there for several years, taking over that so he had this church and then\nFrench River. In between when he must have ahd a little time - back ill the '30's - he was a\npastor up in Eveleth, at that church, so he spent some ofhis time - I say a third ofhis time­see,\nhe had three churches - and so he was busy.\nEveleth in the '30's-\nWell, I know because I used to accompany him. I used to play that organ there - kind of a\nreed organ- they had somebody blowing it or pumping it from behind or whatever - so - 1­that\nwas a long trek.\nCan you imagine some of the dinners-Iutefisk?\nOh, that was important part of- in those days - and as I say, lake trout - you see the\nconnection we had was French river - then - I remember going up with dad one morning and\nwaiting for the - Mr. Sundstrom - Mr.Gunderson- they write out -having pulled up their nets\nand fish and so forth -really fresh fish- I remember getting it and putting it on the back seat\nand offwe went to betherl- fresh - so we had lake trout suppers. That was very good. Of\ncourse I do like lutefisk, so that was - still do! You could have it everyday and twice on\nSundays.\nWhat about special times like holidays - Christmas, Easter - were those a lot of\nA lot ofactivity in the church - you know, Sunday school program here, and we all had to\ntake part in that and - special church events - Christmas morning you'd always have morning\nservices at 6 o'clock in the morning.! it was called - surprising how many people came out\nfor that ~ frost on the windows ---candles next to the windows, you know - it was very very\n,\nDid you open presents before or after?\nDon't say presents - present - we were lucky then. That was a special service - course we\nhad Easter service also. Good Friday - Good Friday services we had in combiuation with\nother churches - we had Elim, .. and other churches. Isn't that funny, I can't remember too\nmuch on that. Don't know. Can't remember ..\nConfirmation and •••••\nAnd then after coufirmation the group that we called our Junior league or Luther League ­pretty\nactive\nHow would you describe the Luther league •••?\nHave a program and - I don't know ifwe had speakers or anything like that but -I don't\nrecall. It was an active - very active time.\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 9\nWhere you had officers and had a meeting?\nWe might have ha d a president -\nDances or parties?\nOh, heavens, are you kidding? You must be. We weren't even allowed to go dancing or to a\n'movie -or- times have changed. It was strict.\nIt must have been difficult for you going to the public school and\n1 always think back going to prom night -I think it was at the Spaulding - we got dressed up\n- and nobody asked me to dance because the kids all knew 1was the minister's daughter, so 1\nwas there for a wallflower.\nWell, you were lucky - I don't think anybody ever asked me to go.\nWell, 1 mean 1went - a bunch of- you know- As 1 say 1 didn't get to dance.\nHe was pastor here for a long- a relatively long-\n26 years.\nDid - from the time you came to the time - did that change quite a bit?\nTil the time he retired?\nWere churchpeople more liberal and the Sewdish services?\nOh, no, he cut out the Swedish services - Well, 1don't recall too much. You see, 1went in\nnurses' training in 193 and 1 don't know - 1came back here to Duluth in 37 - but well, yes, 1\ns'pose 1came back to live at home because 1startedto work - 1 don't remember - isn't it sad\n- I'm getting aged it's hard to remember - you were home, too\nSpecial memories ofthe Depression years in Duluth?\nThey certainly weren't very good but everybody was in the same predicament. Cause, things\nweren't as costly as they are now so we managed. 1think from what 1 remember - was his\nsalary $125 a month - he when he passed away in 1953 - from '46 on, when he retired, his\npension was $35 a month.\nWho was - when you say he had a boss he reported to?\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 10\nThey were called bishops - or it'd be like the head of the synod - Augustana Synod - and I\nthink it was probably - they had branches - the ministers from this area maybe had to report\nto someone down in the cities But they main synod was in Rock Island, I think - the\nAugustana, so - oh, yeh\nThere was a hierarchy?\nOh, yes, oh, sure they had to. They had all these obligations and things when the church - the\nmain church now what it is called is Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\nUrn, women's role in the church - how would you describe that?\nVery active I would say.\nLadies' aid society?\nVery active, um-hmm, Dorcas society, they were the mainstay ofthe church, you know, in\nthose days, very active. I think in most churches they are still the mainstay. The groups and\nthe things that they do. It was a very active church. Good choir, and there's a picture on the\nwall now. Alberta directed the choir. It's so little. He was quite a musician.\nAnd you said some ofthe services were in Swedish?\nMost people could understand Swedish. I could understand Swedish quite a bit. 1did way\nback. Come to church and hear Dad preach in Swedish, I couldn't quite get it all. At home, if\nhe and my mother wanted to talk about something and they didn't want us to know what they\nwere talking about, they'd speak Swedish and we knew what the were talkin about. We\ncou trans ate that. It was a little bit different.\nSpeak in Swedish?\nI suppose most ofthem. He did a lot ofperiodicals too for the church. And then he wrote for\nthe? But... periodicals for the church itselfand so\nAny other humorous stories?\nHow many people are going to listen? Statute of limitation run out?\nWe can delete some of it. Other things that might shed some light on\nOh, other thing he did for a hobby, he built boats. Like rowboats. I don't know. He had\nspecial- Weide, and long at the bow Garage and our basement. I don't know how many he\nhad built. How many years - maybe you don't recall the Knudsen Shipyard - ofcourse, it\nwas in Superior- and in fact I know the granddaughter of the Knudsens, and anyway he came\none time to look at my dad's boat and he complimented him on it, he said it was a very well\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 11\ndone. So that's what he did as a hobby, in his spare time. After writing and preaching and all\nthese other things. A winder man.\nParades and carpentry and wood-working••• Character, do with your families •••\nI know one thing that I do all these years I always any place that I go, I always go about half\nan hour before I have to be there because I don't want to be late because I remember dad\nsaying I'd rather be anyplace a half hour early that a haifa minute late. And I carry that\ntradition. I think people have - I'm a believer in being early. That carried over here with me\ntoo ofcourse.\nStrong work ethic, I s'pose?\nWell, not _ I can't say that.\nYour father and n!'w your brother •••\nWell, I've stayed single and been in the nursing profession most ofmy life except for 20\nyears now I've been retired from it. I kept pretty busy. I spent most ofmy nursing time at the\nDuluth Clinic. 39 years - surgery section - surgeons, orthopedics, and for 10 years\nsupervisor ofnurses and aides, and so that was very interesting work.\nYou told earlier •••\n1988.\nStory behind that.\nWell, we have this organization or so-called - Finland Swedes; they get together - Margaret\nOrley started this many years ago- might be over 10 now - she passed away last year - and\nshe said something about - she asked at one ofthe luncheons ifany ofus would be interested\nin taking a trip tpo Finland, so I was interested. Because 1didn't know of any relatives at that\ntime - maybe this was a good time to look up somebody ifwe get up to the Verkas area so\nshe organized this tour and I think there were 22 ofus but we weren't all from Duluth. That\nwent ofthis trip - we spent - 2 liz days in Verkas, that's all but while the planning was going\non had been over in Finland and found a Harry Silfversten that lived in Memphis, and we\ncorresponded and so then there was a reason and I was invited to stay with them which I did\nand so we got to see the church where Dad grew up - it was built in 1453 - a beautiful church\nand he had been back in 1927 and preached there so I was - I took some pictures ofthe pulpit\nbecause it was up pretty high and those churches they are and then take in a couple of\ncemeteries and found some more Sifverstens - only they were below ground at that point, and\nit was a funny feeling to be way over in Finland and then you see these tombstones - the\nfellow named - same as ours - of. Course it was correct - in past years trying to find more\nSilfversten's -this Harry Silfversten - did start a genealogy- ofSilfversten - and I was able\nto fill in a few things about our family and then I have - its in booklet form, cheaper than this,\nand find out there are several Silfverstens in this country bot they've changed their name to\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 12\nSilverstone so - you can't - at this point in my life. I'm too old now to go through some more\nhistory - I've done enough. But why - it all comes at this time in my life - these things - and\nyet a ways back, we wouldn't have been interested- we weren't. Now how important is-\nWhen you're reading these stories of your father's translated, are you making\ndiscoveries ••\nI have to admit that I haven't looked through them yet.. I shouldn't say I have no time, but I\nhave to start one of these days and start fromthe beginning, but just from what I have read,\nsome portions -I'm amazed at what he did, in writing. I can't believe this was all published in\n1931- my goodness. And all the facts, my goodness, he really delved into this history of the\nFinland-Swedes here in America. I was kind of hoping Mr. Fortnerwas here; I was goingto\nask him how to ? about - I'd like to have this edited but not for anybody's information,just\nfor my sister and me becausethis can be destroyed- it's worth something I meanto me, I\nguess.\nBethany home?\nThe children's home. Its called North Woods - Bethany crises center it is on 40th\navenue west just right above the railroad tracks. It was on 40th I remember and not the\n- the big building'was on 40th but the other one was down on the avenue because I\nremember going over there sometimes. It was a big house - on the comer from the\nsupermarket. That was the first then they built and went across the railroad tracks and\nthat big building is still there - it is called Northwoods Crises Center.\nDid your dad have any connection?\nI suppose I think he went there and may have had a speaker and spoke one time or\nother but it was a place for orphans and I don't know ifthey had any programs. Ijust\nremember going there once but I can't remember what ifwe had a bunch of church\nhere to go or - that is a long, long time ago.\nBy the way this coming year 1988 or 1989 its going to be 100 years old - this is 1998\nI know but it would be a 100 years old or 99 years old - because I asked Mr. ? that\nlast year because he mentioned about removing the corner stone when the church was\n100 years old and so forth so I think. either this year or -\nWhat year did your father retire?\n1946.\nHe turned it over to another pastor?\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\nJanuary 29, 1998\nPage 13\nOh yes and from then there were several pastors. Two or three. Matson was the last\nand who was the other one? Falk after dad.\nI don't remember when the church - Mr. Fortner. had this church for about 10 years\nand it was empty for a while before Mr. F bought it.\nDid you dad continue to write after he retired?\nOh yes he continued to write, fishing, fishing.\nHe painted several altar paintings for various churches. He painted French River\nLutheran and there is one now that is Holy Cross and that's a big one that is in the\nFireside room. There is one in Fellowship Hall in French River. I understand that\nthere are others in Concordia when we belonged to that little white church. He\npainted that alter painting and I think somebody mentioned the Arnold Church which\nis now the Family ofGod church there should be something there. I haven't pursued\n'all ofthese leads. We do know that he was wonderful artist. And music and whatever\nhe was - practically everything. A farmer. And a newspaper - he wrote and was\neditor ofthe Mound Sun Newspaper. He composed music, opera. Now this is our\nbrother not our father.\nAnything else?\nHe used to love children and in our home there on Central Avenue, his study of\ncourse was offthe living room and the windows on the study face the porch because\nthat was years ago when they all had process and the little kids in the neighborhood\nEnd of tape"

The Ojibwe and Dakota people, the largest American Indian tribes living in Minnesota in the early and mid-nineteenth century, were joined by an influx of European émigrés settling in Minnesota in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

This is an interview with Naomi Silfversten, and Ruth Silfversten Coppins,\\npetty Hamspen, Ruth and Naomi are sisters and they grew up in the West End of\\nDuluth and your father's name was Carl J. Silfversten.\\nCan you give me a background on where your father and mother were born and how\\nthey came to this country?\\nMy father was born in the Swedish section or part of Finland and the town was Narpes,\\nFinland. Mother was born in Sweden, Skane. (with an umlaut, I think.)\\nMother's name?\\nEllen Benson.\\nWilen were they born?\\nM9ther was born in 1883. I remember that. Because she was 95 just about 96 when she died\\nand that was in 1979.\\nWas your father older than your mother?\\nYes, about 4 years or so - so 1879.\\nThey immigrated - stories?\\nWell, Dad was 19 years old when he came here and he wanted to go into the ministry\\neventually so he had to go to school and I believe he probably came from Rock Island or that\\narea and I don't know much about the - after 19 I suppose he had to get - he had an education\\nin Finland and they came here because he did get to Gustavus Adolphus College and from\\nthere he went to Theological Seminary; that was in Rockford. This is where he met Mother as\\nshe was a member ofthe church and the choir and they were married.\\nDid he tell you about life in Finland?\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 2\\nNo but - well I'm quite sure he was a poor child and like so many immigrants because they\\nwanted to get a better - have a better life so he was interested in becoming a minister and this\\nwas his goal to come to this country to study.\\nWas his father a minister?\\nNo, his father was a captain ofthe high seas or a fisherman - a commercial fisherman on the\\ngulfof 01 so Dad was sort of raised to be a fisherman when he was a child so Dad has\\nwritten several books but he has that one that is a safe channel that he writes stories regarding\\nthe - ofthe days with his dad fishing.\\nI am pretty sure I have that at home.\\nI have that one too. And I don't have much on my mother's background. Apparently she was\\njust a baby when she came here to this country.\\nSo your father was a Swede-Finn?\\nDad always said Finland Swede and - Swedes are born iii Finland and which is - I had made\\na trip there- it would be ten years this year and I visited the area where Dad was from and it's\\non the west coast - the GulfofB.? -and I don't know how many towns or cities are included\\nin all ofthe west coast but it does go up quite a ways and I don't have that map with me. It's\\nFinland and all outside on the west coast ofFinland.\\nIt was settled by Swedish people?\\nYes.\\nFinnish government?\\nI suppose they had to be. Part ofthe time they were undertheRussian - in 1917 then Finland\\ndeclared its independence.\\nWere they amongst Swedish speaking people?\\nOh yes the whole area is. Jim was on that trip too.\\nWhen your father came here did he come by himself?\\nI understand that.\\nAny relatives?\\nNot that I'm aware of. Not that we know.\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project .\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 3\\nWe had relatives way up in T., He didn't come over the same time she did and\\nwhether she was born over there or in this country - I don't know. That is the only known\\nrelative I can think of.\\nWhen did he come here?\\n1819.\\nWhat did he do when he first came here?\\nI suppose he had to go on in school, I don't know ifhe completed high school in Finland so\\ncalled- he probably did but then he went to Gustavus College in the summer he used to - in\\nfact he came to Duluth. I remember him telling us in 1905 and he worked on the coal docks\\nin order to get some money for school and at that time he also - he didn't join but he would\\ngo to the Bethany Lutheran church in West End and I think he taught Saturday Bible School­something\\nlike that and ~ but and then from then he ofcourse\\nWhen did he meet your mother?\\nWhen they probably came to S.? in that area. I don't know much about them landing here. I\\nknow that she was - well he was at this church in Chicago because she was from Chicago and\\nhe met her at church naturally because he was interested in becoming a minister and she­mother\\nwas in the choir and so apparently the romance started that way and so they were\\nmarried and then - married in Chicago.\\nSo he graduated from Gustavus and went on to Augustana Seminary in Rock Island, IL.\\nGraduated?\\nIt must have been 1909 because it seemed to me they were married in 1909.... Church? The\\nfirst church he was assigned to was in Worchester, Massachusetts, and then from there they\\nmoved to Gladstone, ML He was a SwedishlFinland minister. He had these churches that\\nwere Swede/Finn origin and then went to Gladstone, ML, went to Ironwood, Michigan, then\\nto Rhinelander, WI and then ofcourse in 1920 he was called here to Bethel,\\nDid he stay in Duluth?\\nYes until he passed away. He was the pastor ofthis church for 26 years.\\nWhere were you guys born?\\nI was born in Ironwood.\\nI was born in Rhinelander and our brother was born in Gladstone.\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Rnth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 4\\nWhat is your brother's name?\\nHilden?? And of course she was a twin and the other brother passed away when he was 19\\nmonths old.\\nThen the family moved to Duluth and that is where all-\\nThere was - this church had a parsonage down the block here and - so that. is where we were\\nfor a period oftime. I don't remember how long because at that time Dad decided he wanted\\nto build his own home so he got some property up on Central Avenue so - but at that time\\nmother took ill and she was an invalid from the time she was 40 years old until she died in\\n1995. But nevertheless we managed to get along. They sold the parsonage and then we\\nmoved down to 53\\\" this way temporarily until our house became livable or we could move\\nin. So that is where we spent most ofour time.\\nWhat do you remember about your ethnic group?\\nI don't recall what we singled out -we chummed around with anyone and everybody. We\\nhad different nationalities. I can't say that we singled out the Swedes or Finns. A great part of\\nour time was spent here at church. When we went to school or out to play it was all\\nnationalities. But I think that we had a normal growing up as anybody else. Except that we\\nwere the minister's kids and you felt you had to be so good because your father was a\\nminister.\\nIt is a lot different now. Even the ministers are different. It's kind ofnice because - you're\\nsomething a little special. I don't know ifthey felt that way or not. We lived a normal life.\\n------:-----Htilro.-.wVlfabhOlrurrtt-allJ1mniiinnmisltt\\u003c\\u003eerr\\\"'s-Ufe in those days?-----------------------\\nVisit sick people, that is part oftheir ministers in the homes or in the hospital and he had to\\nattend a lot of different meetings with other ministers and they had to go out oftown and the\\nconference meetings and things like that. Dad was not interested in sports or anything but he\\nloved to fish so any time that he could get up to Boulder Lake or Fish Lake or sometime I\\nremember being with him a couple oftimes and he was very patient and we just sat all day in\\nthe boat.\\nI remember going on part ofhis vacation with him once because he went up to Eagles' Nest\\nLake and he had fixed the car the back seat - the back part ofthe seat so they would go down\\nand you could sleep in the car and I remember being up there with him for several days with\\nhim and I don't remember how old 1 was but I remember-\\nHe loved to fish.\\nI remember also one time he fished at Islaud Lake and the blinding snow storm on the first\\nfishing day ofthe season May 15 so here we are in January thinking ofwhat we might have\\nto look forward to.\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPageS\\nHow would you describe a typical week for a miuister?\\nChurch, church. Oh well yes and his daughters and son spent all of our time here. We used to\\nhave three services on Sunday: a Swedish, and English, and a Swedish at night and we three\\nkids so caIled we all had to take our turns at being the organist -we alI had training - we all\\nhad lessons of course piano and organ so brother first because he was older and then I went\\non to nurses' training and my sister, Ruth. So we alI had to spend lots oftime here and lots of\\ntime then we would have prayer meetings on Wednesday we had to be here. Friday was choir\\npractice because then we had to take care ofthe choir and then the three services on Sunday.\\nOfcourse Saturday was confirmation and for whatever. We had willing workers and I\\nremember we had it in that second room especially when it was real cold and Dad would put\\nfire in that little stove so we huddled around that.\\nIs this the organ?\\nThat's the organ -that's the one we played.\\nSo you were the center of attention?\\nWell, we didn't have a choice; put it that way.\\nAny stories?\\nI can't remember but like I say it's a little different now with pastors' families. Kids speak up\\nmore than - I belong to Pilgrim Lutheran church in Superior and I have been there ever since\\n---------I've-bllen-marrilld-m1d-so-I've-been-going-as-member~nd_I-knew-the-family-life-is-a-little-bitt-----­different\\nthan they were when Naomi and my brother and I grew up here. But that was the\\ntimes; everything has changed. And one thing I have to say that I am proud to say that I was\\nbrought up in the minister's home. I am very happy that that time-\\nEven ifthey were so strict. Mother wasn't but Dad ofcourse -he ruled the roost, I can tell\\nyou.\\nWas he a strict miuister?\\nWeIl, it wasn't fire and brimstone, I don't think. He had some good sermons. You know-\\nWas the church a place where somebody was coming from Sweden - did they come to\\nthe church in those early days?\\nWe did have quite a few people that came over from Finland and find our church. I think it\\nwas mostly the men who came and some ofthem went back and some didn't go back to\\nFinland.\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 6\\nOftenwe had visitors to cometo the church; guess wherethey stayed overnight. We would be\\nroutedout ofour cribs or bedsto take care ofsome other ministerthat is comingto visit. But\\nit didn't hurt us.\\nDid you get late night phone calls of death in someone's family?\\nI don't recall muchofthat. Dadhad a studyand -\\nOnething about himthat - he quite oftenhe was up in the middle ofthe night andthen he\\nwould go downto the kitchenand cookand drinkhis coffeeand study and write sermonsand\\nof coursehe did write somebookstoo but that is whenhe did his thinking becausehe said it\\nwas always more quiet in the houseduringthe nightthan it was duringthe day whenwe were\\naround. Quiet, quietdownthere.\\nWas he a prolific writer?\\nYes he was. Hehad outlinesbecauseI think I have somestill at home- someoutlinesand ­he\\nwouldpreach fromthem.\\nHe wrote a book?\\nYes I happenedto - I haven't had time to - I have all these and I have to get this all together\\n- the Finland Swedes in America; this is it. It waspublished in 1931 and it is all here\\ntranslatedto the English languagebut howI received these was through the Swede-Finn\\nHistorical Societyand there referredto the Finland Swedes had a lodge and they are still\\nactive out west- Bruneberg Lodgeandthe Bruneberg Lodgeof Seattle is then there - they\\nhad publications calledthe LeadingStaror in Swedish? but - so the editor of that paper,\\n---------I\\\\}oug Hansen,we were in touch or contactandhe said that we WIll seethat youget the\\npublication and this is of course I wouldtake it out likethis and so there is 26 chapters. It was\\na big book;just by lookingat all of this you can see what our fatherwas doingin the middle\\nofthe night besidewriting for sermons andthis wasn't the only book.\\nDid he ever tell you why?\\nOh,he was so proud ofhis peopleand he felt it andthen of coursehe traveledto get some\\n. information for the book.He went out west andthere are quitea few Finland Swedes in that\\narea, and California and out in Michigan and Mass. Andalso Australia; there are a lot of\\nFinns and Swedes. Sothis is what I say; he reallydid quitea bit of-\\nHe knew of the other people who were working the church; is that where he got the\\ninformation?\\nIpresume he got that throughmanypeopleand I think towardthe end here the several people\\nthat menthat were influenced him andthat is wherehe got informationfrom.\\nHe wrote that in Swedish?\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Rnth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJannary 29, 1998\\nPage 7\\nYes, in Swedish.\\nWas he in the lodge?\\nWe - I think we were members for a while. W.e weren't lodge people; we never had been.\\nThere wasn't any reason to. It was a sick benefit.\\nWas there a chapter here in Duluth?\\nThey had many years ago but they had it - there were two up on the range also.\\nWhat other books did he write?\\nI have sent a couple ofours out there. Well we know \\\"Safe Channels\\\" aud then \\\"My\\nHome... \\\" and I don't remember the translation ofthe rest of it. I don't have the list with me\\nthat I sent to the Historical Society.\\nDid he perform a lot of weddings?\\nI imagine he did at one time; it was a very busy church and congregation. And so he it was a\\nlot ofactivity in this church.\\nHow many members?\\n200 or so. Maybe when they were at the peak time might have been.\\nWas this church built when he arrived?\\nYes, it was. Yes, because there were other ministers here before Dad came. Pastor Oberg was\\nhere. Kastlin? was here at that time.\\nYou said there were 200 or 300 people and you had church services and choir practices;\\nwere there other social things and choir practices?\\nWe had dinners and church suppers - oh yes, and we eveb had lutefisk suppers and trout\\nsuppers - must say something right at this popoibnt, too,that dad organized a church out in\\nfrench river - a church oput there - he felt the need - beind Dad was so interested infishing\\nand all he fel the need along the shore out there and then found out they were Finland­Swedes\\nand that there was quite a number ofthem - maybe, it was kind ofa mission church\\nat the time out there so he did organizethat too. They built after a while but the fi5rst so­called\\nservices were held in the homes - and then after that they did buid a church up on the\\nRyan road and that was there until they decided - I'm trying to thiuk ofthe date - 51 or 2­52\\nand then they had ground-breaking for the new church onRyan road that's there now - so\\nit's an active church.\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 8\\nAnother pastor?\\nNo, he was the pastor there for several years, taking over that so he had this church and then\\nFrench River. In between when he must have ahd a little time - back ill the '30's - he was a\\npastor up in Eveleth, at that church, so he spent some ofhis time - I say a third ofhis time­see,\\nhe had three churches - and so he was busy.\\nEveleth in the '30's-\\nWell, I know because I used to accompany him. I used to play that organ there - kind of a\\nreed organ- they had somebody blowing it or pumping it from behind or whatever - so - 1­that\\nwas a long trek.\\nCan you imagine some of the dinners-Iutefisk?\\nOh, that was important part of- in those days - and as I say, lake trout - you see the\\nconnection we had was French river - then - I remember going up with dad one morning and\\nwaiting for the - Mr. Sundstrom - Mr.Gunderson- they write out -having pulled up their nets\\nand fish and so forth -really fresh fish- I remember getting it and putting it on the back seat\\nand offwe went to betherl- fresh - so we had lake trout suppers. That was very good. Of\\ncourse I do like lutefisk, so that was - still do! You could have it everyday and twice on\\nSundays.\\nWhat about special times like holidays - Christmas, Easter - were those a lot of\\nA lot ofactivity in the church - you know, Sunday school program here, and we all had to\\ntake part in that and - special church events - Christmas morning you'd always have morning\\nservices at 6 o'clock in the morning.! it was called - surprising how many people came out\\nfor that ~ frost on the windows ---candles next to the windows, you know - it was very very\\n,\\nDid you open presents before or after?\\nDon't say presents - present - we were lucky then. That was a special service - course we\\nhad Easter service also. Good Friday - Good Friday services we had in combiuation with\\nother churches - we had Elim, .. and other churches. Isn't that funny, I can't remember too\\nmuch on that. Don't know.

It was an active - very active time.\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 9\\nWhere you had officers and had a meeting?\\nWe might have ha d a president -\\nDances or parties?\\nOh, heavens, are you kidding? You must be. We weren't even allowed to go dancing or to a\\n'movie -or- times have changed. It was strict.\\nIt must have been difficult for you going to the public school and\\n1 always think back going to prom night -I think it was at the Spaulding - we got dressed up\\n- and nobody asked me to dance because the kids all knew 1was the minister's daughter, so 1\\nwas there for a wallflower.\\nWell, you were lucky - I don't think anybody ever asked me to go.\\nWell, 1 mean 1went - a bunch of- you know- As 1 say 1 didn't get to dance.\\nHe was pastor here for a long- a relatively long-\\n26 years.\\nDid - from the time you came to the time - did that change quite a bit?\\nTil the time he retired?\\nWere churchpeople more liberal and the Sewdish services?\\nOh, no, he cut out the Swedish services - Well, 1don't recall too much.

Cause, things\\nweren't as costly as they are now so we managed. 1think from what 1 remember - was his\\nsalary $125 a month - he when he passed away in 1953 - from '46 on, when he retired, his\\npension was $35 a month.\\nWho was - when you say he had a boss he reported to?\\nSwedish Immigrant Oral History Project\\nNaomi Silfversten, Ruth Silfversten Coppins, Betty Hamspen\\nJanuary 29, 1998\\nPage 10\\nThey were called bishops - or it'd be like the head of the synod - Augustana Synod - and I\\nthink it was probably - they had branches - the ministers from this area maybe had to report\\nto someone down in the cities But they main synod was in Rock Island, I think - the\\nAugustana, so - oh, yeh\\nThere was a hierarchy?\\nOh, yes, oh, sure they had to. They had all these obligations and things when the church - the\\nmain church now what it is called is Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\\nUrn, women's role in the church - how would you describe that?\\nVery active I would say.\\nLadies' aid society?\\nVery active, um-hmm, Dorcas society, they were the mainstay ofthe church, you know, in\\nthose days, very active. I think in most churches they are still the mainstay. The groups and\\nthe things that they do. It was a very active church. Good choir, and there's a picture on the\\nwall now.

I could understand Swedish quite a bit. 1did way\\nback. Come to church and hear Dad preach in Swedish, I couldn't quite get it all. At home, if\\nhe and my mother wanted to talk about something and they didn't want us to know what they\\nwere talking about, they'd speak Swedish and we knew what the were talkin about. We\\ncou trans ate that. It was a little bit different.\\nSpeak in Swedish?\\nI suppose most ofthem. He did a lot ofperiodicals too for the church. And then he wrote for\\nthe?
